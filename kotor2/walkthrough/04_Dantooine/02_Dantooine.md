- Visas
  - What have you done to the crew?
- .. FIGHT ... use shields and stimulants with the pause menu

- Visas
  - **I will not kill you.** `a_givelight(1)`
    - Look, you're wounded. Stand, let me get you to the medbay. `a_givelight(1)`
  - What's a Miraluka?
    - Maybe she knows.
    - See through the Force?
  - Is her kind rare?
    - **Killing one?**
  - Is she going to be all right? `a_givelight(1)`
  - If her condition changes, let me know - I didn't want to hurt her. `a_givelight(1)`

- Grabbed emitter
- HK repair
- Kreia -- **required: `c_ac_int_gt(14)` or `c_ac_int_lt(15)+c_sc_awa_gt(14)`**
  - I don't understand how she tracked us down.
    - **Ties to her master, perhaps. And I intend to follow that bond to its source when the opportunity presents itself.** `a_influence_inc(6, 2)`
    - Atton said her planet was wiped out, that it was the only colony of her people in this sector of the galaxy.
    - [Awareness] Well, if her people all see through the Force, then maybe someone wanted to blind them. `c_ac_int_lt(15)+c_sc_awa_gt(14)`
    - [Awareness] Someone wants this sector of the galaxy blind to the Force. So they can move freely... or strike without warning. `c_ac_int_lt(15)+c_sc_awa_gt(14)`
    - I had other questions.
  - When Visas attacked, she did something to my eyesight.
    - What?
    - All right.
    - [Computer Use] Hey, T3 has a stuck motivator.
    - [Repair] Hey, I can hear a catch in it. It's not fully fixed.
    - [Awareness] I heard her thoughts. `c_sc_awa_gt(10)`
    - But... how did I do that? `a_addforcepoints(6)&&a_adjust_skill(3, 1)`
    - [You have gained +1 Awareness and recovered some of your connection to the Force.]
- Level up! 14
- Go to Visas `Wisdom >= 16`
  - **Are you all right?** `a_givelight(1)&&a_influence_inc(9, 1)`
  - That's not what I asked. I asked if you were all right.
  - **In medbay, I... we... noticed you have scars. Who hurt you?** `a_givelight(1)&&a_influence_inc(9, 1)`
  - How did you find me?
  - Who sent you?
  - I need to know where I can find your Master.
  - Ready?
  - **My life is unimportant - your Master threatens more than just me.** `a_givelight(1)&&a_influence_inc(9, 1)`
  - **If he is behind what has befallen the Jedi, then he must be stopped.** `a_givelight(1)&&a_influence_inc(9, 1)`
  - Why are you doing this for me?
  - If your master has trouble detecting me, how are you able to do it?
  - // AFTERWARDS -> Where are your people, your world, now? `!c_influence_bet(9, 31, 69)`
  - Was your Master the one sent to Peragus?
    - // What do you mean? // -> same as next
    - Forget it. I had some other questions for you.
  - Was your Master behind the destruction of Peragus?
    - Forget it. I had some other questions for you.
  - I have heard your species is blind. How are you able to see?
    - You sound as if that sight is lost to you. `!c_influence_bet(9, 20, 80)`
    - **When one endures, it gives hope to others - and themselves.** `a_lightsml();a_influence_inc(9, 1)`
  - How do you see through the Force? `!c_influence_bet(9, 10, 90)`
  - Never mind. I'll be going now.
  - **Because I believe you can be saved.** `a_lightsml();a_influence_inc(9, 3)`
  - **To help another is not weakness - it is strength to them both.** `a_givelight(1)`
  - What do you mean?
  - Tell me about your homeworld. -> same as before...
    - **I have seen similar acts of destruction... at Malachor.**
    - How was it destroyed?
    - If your homeworld was destroyed, how did you survive?
    - ...as if everything suddenly went silent.
    - You were the only survivor?
    - He made you see?
    - And why did your Master show you this?
    - I don't understand - it would have taken several Republic cruisers to destroy the surface of Katarr.
    - Why did your Master destroy Katarr?
    - Why did the Jedi meet on Katarr?
    - He attacked it because the Jedi had gone there?
    - [Wisdom] Or it may starve him... make him more desperate. `c_ac_wis_gt(15)`
    - Just thinking out loud. Why did the Jedi meet on Katarr?
    - Forget it. I had some other questions for you.

- Workbench -> create for against bio (energy protection won't be much)
  - Balistic overlay II
  - Restoration II
- Leave with Kreia and T3 (infl+ with droids repaired -- to be fixed)
- Go to the sublevel of the enclave
- Kaevee -> the thef! (lips not working)
  - Are you the thief that Suulru is complaining about?
  - What are you doing down here?
  - Who are you?
  - [Awareness] I sense you have a connection to the Force.
  - Why be a Jedi? They're a lost cause.
  - You can forge your own path. Free of rules.
  - Where is your master?
  - Someone named Vrook came here not too long ago.
  - About stealing...
  - I'm a Jedi and could use any artifacts you've found.
  - What did it say?
  - Was it a Sith holocron? Holocron can be dangerous.
  - Listen to your master's lessons. Not the holocron.
  - Where is the holocron now?
  - What are you going to do now?
  - May the Force be with you.
- All the parts for a light saber! Wait for workbench + crystals cave
- Jorran
  - Could you open the door?
  - Are you Jorran?
  - There are still some laigreks around.
- Kill the closest laigrek
- Jorran
  - The laigreks in this area are dead.
    - Before you go - what were you doing down here?
    - Why were you down here if it's so dangerous?
      - Almost nobody...? Who's the almost?
      - How did they die?
      - How can dead people cause problems?
      - Daraala had me looking for their bodies. To lay them to rest.
      - Her deceit won't gain her anything.
      - I want to talk about something else.
    - Did you find anything down here?
      - I know you found something. Taepalae told me.
      - Any chance you could give me what you found as a reward?
      - Could I buy them off of you?
      - Can I see what it is first?
      - I'm afraid I don't have that kind of money. -> 1000c later instead of 1300c
- Next rooms start with open doors -> dead salvager
- Get mine unlock doors then SAVE -> Guerevik spawn
- Droid room -> repair all with T3 -> kill the laigrek! -> T3 warns you! `Modules/610dan/prot_drd.dlg`
  - Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part)
  - [Repair] Diagnose speech system
  - ... `Modules/610dan/610t3greet.dlg`
  - I don't care about this droid's design flaw. I'm sure we can use it to our advantage.
  - I didn't realize the power core was unstable. Good thing you noticed that. Thanks T3. `a_influence_inc(8, 0)` -> BUG should be +1 not 0 within `Modules/610dan/610t3greet.dlg`
  - Engage droid in "Meet and Greet" mode. (<CUSTOM45> repair part(s))
- Leave some space between droids -> will explode in contact with enemy
- 280 XP per droid repaired + 200 XP is they explode
- Loot on the right
- Computer solo mode
  - Overload terminal (<CUSTOM35> spike(s)).

- Historian
  - Thanks for the polite bow. You must be a gentleman.
  - What are you doing here?
    - [Awareness] That's not the only reason. `c_sc_awa_gt(11)`
    - Left?
    - What others?
    - You mentioned holocrons? `Atris took them...`
    - Why is that?
  - Do you know what happened to the Jedi?
    - Why do you think people hate the Jedi?
    - But Jedi have protected the galaxy for centuries - they seek peace, often through sacrifice.
    - Do you hate the Jedi?
    - What do you mean?
    - I was one of those Jedi. I must accept part of that responsibility.
    - Revan and Malak would have received the same training as I did.
    - Go on.
    - **Do you know who trained Revan?** `Kae -> Kreia!`
    - I want to talk about something else.
  - Why do you work for the Republic?
    - Why Telos and Onderon?
    - And Onderon?
    - **Why is Dantooine important?**
      - alt: Why are the Jedi Order important?
  - Tell me about the Republic.
    - What happened?
    - What do you mean?
  - You look familiar to me. `they met before..!`
  - I'll be going now.
  - The Sith are awake in the galaxy, and I'm going to need their help to stop them.
  - Trust me, the Sith are out there. They've been hounding me since Peragus.
  - We would welcome your company. `a_influence_inc(11) only if Atton in the group` 
- Keep T3 and him
- Loot mercenaries -> ordered to find Vrook
- Will->
  - Don't change the will
- Before leaving
  - I don't suppose you'd like to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this situation?

Back to the camp
- Jorran -- not very interesting already everything you need -> LS part with theif -> not much sense
  - How much do you want for the Jedi artifacts? -> now it's only 1000c!
  - Can I see them?
  - I'm afraid I don't have that kind of money. -> not buying. Just a crystal that is interesting
- Darala
  - I'd like to talk to you about the dead salvagers.
  - I found their bodies.
  - Here you go. +1000c
- back to Khounda
- Suulru `disciple banter`
  - I found your thrief.
  - Your thief wasn't Jorran or a salvager
  - The salvagers have been hit by this thief, too.
  - **A former padawan was stealing to survive.**
  - She's just a young woman going through tough times.
  - Your world wasn't the only one damaged by Darth Malak.
  - The Jedi were responsible for saving us.
  - **These are the Jedi's darkest days. Thousands of years of service and peace shouldn't be so casually cast aside and spurned.**
- Zherron
  - I gave Dopak your message.
- Before entering the Ebon
- Disciple
    - Well, I hope our enemies think so.
      - I thank you for your kind words, but they are not necessary. `a_givelight(1)`
    - What do you know about Force bonding?
      - I have a connection with another that could be lethal to us both.
      - I have a bond with another that transmits pain across distances - if she suffers, I suffer. If she dies, there's a chance I'll die, too.
      - What?
      - Where would the holocrons be?
      - What do you remember about the bonds?
      - Is such a bond ever lethal?
      - You said feel each other across distances - what about each other's thoughts?
      - I had other questions.
    - **Nothing, never mind.**
      - And why do you want to discuss it?
      - I left to protect the innocents on the Outer Rim. `a_givelight(1)`
      - That was my belief, but recent discoveries seem to indicate there may have been other causes.
      - T3-M4 has a copy of it.
      - I trust you - go ahead. `a_influence_inc(11, 1)`
    - INTERESTING: if T3 in the group, he should ask directly
- To the ship
  - Disciple
    - _{Gameplay Programmer: This cut scene takes place on the Ebon Hawk, the Disciple is studying a series of holographic worlds in the center of the ship.}_
    - _{Gameplay Programmer: The player walks up to the Disciple, studies the worlds with him.}_
    - What are you studying?
    - It is difficult to turn away from the suffering of others - that is why one must help when they can.
    - [Awareness] There's something about the worlds themselves, isn't there? `c_sc_awa_gt(12)`
    - Are you sure you have no idea?
    - I would let it rest - thinking too hard about it will not make the answers come any easier.
  - DONT SPEAK TO KREIA CAUSE YOU REACH LVL 15 -> WAIT FOR NEW LEVEL!
  - Disciple
    - I did not leave the Order - I was exiled.
    - You saw the record. There was no choice - it was a sentence.
    - Why does this interest you?
    - I still don't believe it.
    - Are you sure I don't know you? You look familiar - more so than before. `c_influence_bet(11, 31, 69)`
    - So you turned away from the Jedi - the Force. Because of me?
    - I am sorry that my leaving for war had such... consequences on your future. `a_givelight(1);a_influence_inc(11, 1)`
    - So are you some sort of spy for the Senate?
    - Why did they choose you?
    - Have you had any luck?
    - Do you know what happened to the Jedi?
- Leave with Bao and Kreia





- Go to the cave
- Ahrnell
  - My apologies.
  - I'm just exploring. What are you doing?
  - [Awareness] You are different from most of the mercenaries I've met. `c_sc_awa_gt(11)`
  - You mentioned crystals?
  - [Awareness] The energy you speak of is the Force. I sense some small Force potential within you.
  - I am a Jedi.
  - What do you know about the other mercenaries
  - Why do they keep you out of the loop?
  - Why do you get special privileges?
  - [Persuade] I am an explorer, like you. You can share your secret with me. `c_sc_per_gt(11)`
  - Do you have an extra scent gland I could use?
  - [Persuade] I want to hold your gland.
  - Okay, you can have it back.
- Right to crystals
- Kreia
  - You said the crystals absorb the Force? I feel strange, but not weaker.
  - Tell me more about these crystals.
  - I don't like the idea of leaving behind evidence.
  - Okay.
- Crystal
  - I don't need this. Do you want it?
  - Bah, I've gained a pet crystal. I hope I don't have to feed it.
  - What makes this crystal so special?
  - Is the bond... dangerous?
  - Does the crystal feed off of the Light Side of the Force?
  - Okay.
- Talk to Kria on lvl up -> free level up!
  - It was Visas' Master - he can feel my presence in the Force.
  - Jedi Watchmen should return to the galaxy, and I will be the first to restore them.
    - _From here on, you guide your destiny. But in order to take the next steps, **you must face your past and put it to rest**._
    - `she suggests you to go to Korriban`
- Every body earn a level!!
- Mercenaries
  - So the mercenaries are branching out into kidnapping now?
  - Can I ask you a question?
  - Can we work out some sort of deal?
  - Defend yourselves
- Vrook
  - Always a pleasure, Vrook. I see you still have your cheery disposition.
  - Is this the same "careful timing" you were counting on in the Mandalorian Wars?
  - Revan and Malak were misguided, but without them we'd all be speaking Mandalorian.
- Back
- Sensors
  - What's the problem? We found the sensors. Now we can take them to Saedhe and get paid.
  - [Awareness] Can you examine one of the sensors? `c_sc_awa_gt(4)`
  - Good work Bao-Dur. `a_influence_inc(1)`
- Akul ambush (DS -> possibility for infl+ on Kreia or HK but not yet)
  - What do you want with me?
  - What's in it for me?
  - What do you have in mind?
  - So, you want me to destroy the gun turrets?
  - What about the traps?
  - [Lie] Okay, I'll help you. `Kreia infl+`
  - I'm not interested.
- Saedhe
  - Actually, I've found three of them.
  - Not so fast - we found a little surprise inside them.
  - Why is there surveillance equipment in the sensors?
  - 5000 credits sounds good to me.
- Look the militia put some mines, we are going to move them afterwards
- To the Ebon
- Kreia and Atton for `infl+` -> later when makes sense
- Old man
  - Why so busy?
  - [Awareness] It sounds like you have a lot on your shoulders. `c_sc_awa_gt(11)`
  - [Persuade] You shouldn't keep your frustrations bottled inside. `c_sc_per_gt(9)` `a_influence_inc(6, 1)&&a_local_set(55)` -> Kreia! + Atton
  - You're having trouble with the droids?
  - What's wrong with the doors?
  - Tell me about the turrets.
  - I'll be going now.
- Level up Disciple
- Get in the ebon hawk
- BEFORE ENTERING -> Levelup Disciple!! -> lvl 15 -> will become a Jedi
  - Cutscene
    - Disciple getting bullied
  - **Disciple becomes a jedi** -> CAREFUL! NEED TO LEVEL UP BEFORE FOR A FREE LEVEL
    - What are you doing?
      - Can you teach me to meditate? `a_addforcepoints(10);a_influence_inc(11, 1)`
    - I had other questions.
      - **I could train you to feel the Force again.**
      - Do not bow to me - that will be your first lesson as a Jedi.
      - Then let us meditate - and open ourselves to the Force.
      - Imagine the initial teachings of the Jedi, your first steps within the Enclave.
      - Remember the wind among the plains of Dantooine, the feel of life around you.
      - Think of what you felt when our paths crossed again.
      - And at last... see the galaxy through the Force.
      - [The Disciple has taken his first steps on the path of a Jedi Consular. He will grow in ability as he travels with you and learns what you know of the Force.]
  - Bao lightsaber! `still need some infl for jedi`
    - What are you talking about?
      - So, why are you here?
      - We could let you off wherever we stop next.
      - Even if you knew what was wrong with it, how would you know where to start?
      - It's all wires and switches to you, huh?
      - **I told you, I'm not a Jedi.**
    - Do I have all the lightsaber parts I'll need?
      - One-handed lightsaber.
      - Violet (or whatever found in the cave)
  - Improve LS with what you have -> Don't equip yet, we need to talk to the old man without a ls
  - Kreia - complaining about the number of people gathered
    - As many as want to come with us and help us.
      - What makes you think they obey me?
      - Does the fact they obey me upset you?
      - **I've noticed their behavior is changing - Atton, especially.** `!c_influence_bet(6, 40, 60)`
      - **And what about you?**
      - They are my friends, not tools.
      - What do you mean? `!c_influence_bet(6, 35, 65)`
      - He was a powerful presence - there was little one did not believe when he spoke it with conviction.
      - I thought teachings of the Sith came from Korriban.
      - Do you have any ideas?
      - I had other questions.
    - Can you tell me about the <FullName> Crystal?
    - `CANCELED -> same above` I had questions about how Revan amassed such a huge force against the Republic. `!c_influence_bet(6, 35, 65)` 
    - Did you know Revan? `> +3 infl !`
      - Where did Revan come from?
      - What else do you know of Revan?
      - What caused Revan to fall, to turn on the Republic?
      - Then what made him turn to the Dark Side, become a Sith Lord?
      - **You trained him?** `!c_influence_bet(6, 10, 90)` `a_global_set("000_Kreia_Revan_XP", 1);a_influence_inc(6, 3)`
      - What was Revan like as a student?
      - What do you see when you look at me?
      - What do you know more of Revan?
    - Never mind. I'll be going now.
 - Visas
    - I wanted to teach you some of the techniques I have learned in my travels.
      - Affect Minds
- Leave the Ebon with Disciple and Bao
- Adare
  - Who knows about the attack?
  - What can I do to help?
  - Can you give me anything to help?
  - I'll check out Khoonda's defenses then.
- Speak to Vrook
- Speak to Zehron
  - Cave... -> +2000c
  - How much time do I have?
  - Any idea...
  - What kind of things need fixing?
  - What's involved with finalizing the defenses?
  - I'm going to see what I can do.



- Akkere -- get the thorium charges!
  - Would you be interested in joining the Khoonda militia? `Bug, recrut quest never ends`
  - This isn't a permanent job. Very short term, but dangerous.
  - You can store your wares on my ship.
  - I'll take them.
- Close the door
- Recrut -> not yet. We need to find out about the droid screwdriver...
  - Dillan
    - Would you be interested in joining the Khoonda militia? `Bug, recrut quest never ends`
  - Recrute Jorran
    - Would you be interested in joining the Khoonda militia? `Bug, recrut quest never ends`
- Back to Khoonda
  - Suulru
    - Would you be interested in joining the Khoonda militia? `Bug, recrut quest never ends`
- Medical room
  - [Treat Injury] I'll treat your wounds. `c_sc_tre_gt(11)`
- Medical droid -> T3 or Bao
- Droids with Bao/T3 + get Akere key
- Reprogram droids NO!
- Reprogram turrets
- Leave
- Akkere `infl+ Bao`
  - I found this hydrospanner. It has your name on it.
  - Don't toy with me! I know you have been stripping these droids for parts and selling them.
  - Tell me.
  - **I believe you. Please take 500 credits to help you.**
- Bao comments
  - It was a minor thing, nothing more. `a_influence_inc(1, 1)` + `a_influence_inc(1, 3)`
- Mines -> don't remove mines -> prevent message from happening
  - Add 3 mines in front
  - Add 4 mines in the east
- Kill merc
- Ebon -> Bao Jedi


Assault
- Grenn
  - **There isn't anyone else that can rally the settlers?**
  - Could you tell me about the squads?
  - Main entrance.
  - The back - by the garage.
  - Inside by the administrator's door.
  - I'll take the front.
  - Do I have time to do anything else?
  - Have you talked with the men?
  - [Persuade] I think they could use some encouragement. Maybe I could speak to them.
  - [Persuade] Tell them this is their chance to make history. `c_sc_per_gt(15)`
    - Dantooine's short history has been a constant tale of rugged people surmounting difficult odds. Never have the odds been so great, or the future so uncertain...
    - ... But today is your chapter, your tale. Generations yet born will look upon the upcoming battle with pride and wonder...
    - ... I will not lie, the risks are great. The threat real, but I would stand beside any one of you proudly as we face our destiny on this field of battle...
    - ... This is our day, our valiant chance to free Dantooine. Who will fight beside me?

- // Kreia -> LATER!!
- Reask `-> could be done later`
    - I want you to teach me more about the Force.
      - Before, when you taught me to listen - I wish to continue that lesson.
        - :: That sound in the background - what is it? ::
        - :: I hear you. This... this is incredible. :: `a_addforcepoints(6);a_krepcup()`
        - What about T3?
        - But I did hear something from Bao-Dur.
        - Maybe it is because I know him better; I served with him.
        - **There was also something wrong with Atton's thoughts.**
        - Perhaps. Maybe I will go see him - and see how his pazaak game is coming.
  - Atton
    - Atton, why do you play pazaak in your head?
      - [Repair] There are no ticks in the power coupling - it's fixed. `c_sc_rep_gt(3)`
      - You're not making any sense.
      - I don't want to play pazaak.
      - This better not be using Nar Shaddaa rules.
      - If it's a friendly game, sure.
      - ...
      - I was trying to compute the totals to twenty.
      - **Atton, before, I felt your mind. With Kreia's help. I'm sorry.** `a_influence_inc(1);a_global_set("000_Atton_Pazaak", 90)`
      - What do you have to hide?
      - Is that something you can train me to do?
      - No - I want to learn to shield my mind.
      - Then I want to learn to play pazaak.
      - [Atton has taught you to play pazaak in your head as a way of resisting mental domination. You have gained a permanent +1 to your Willpower saves.]
- I want you to teach me more about the Force.
  - You taught me of sight - is there anything else you can teach me?
  - What do you mean?
  - [Repair]
  - [Treat Injury]
  - Very well. I shall take this lesson to heart. `a_influence_inc(6, 1)`
