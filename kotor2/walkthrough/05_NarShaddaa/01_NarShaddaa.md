- Conversation in the Ebon
  - **So there's lot of ex-soldiers on Nar Shaddaa?**
  - How hard would it be to find a Jedi here?
  - What's the Refugee Sector?
  - [Awareness] You sound like you've been here before. `c_local_set_aw(30, 3)`
  - What's Nal Hutta?
  - // How hard will it be to hide here?
  - Then let's take the Ebon Hawk in for a landing.

`TO FIX: texture of Hanhar`

- Introduction of people who will try to kill you!
- Arrival on Nar Shaddaa
  - Is this the Refugee Sector?
  - Any problems with the docking authorities?
  - Are we going to be okay on this landing pad?
  - // The Ebon Hawk looks a little exposed. `DONT, prevent some banters`
  - **Then let's move on.**
    - I wouldn't mind getting some new equipment.
    - I want to find out more about this bounty on Jedi. `Visas + Disciple want to help for the Bounty`
    - If Zez-Kai Ell is here, I want to find him.
    - I'm just looking for a place to lay low.
    - Let's see where our path takes us.
  - It's a landing pad - ships land on it.
  - What other ship?
  - Junk? You're lucky my ship's gracing your trash heap.

TEST
- Take Atton & Bao? Bao will have some banters
  - What's going on here?
  - Exchange business? That's why I'm here.
  - I've come here to meet with the Exchange. The two of us have business.
  - Tell your employers that <FullName> has come to Nar Shaddaa to meet with them.
  - Why does the Exchange care what happens to this man?
  - I won't let you hurt that man. Stand away from him. `a_lightsml()`
- Kill the thugs
- Talk to the man `Wrong head with voice...`
  - I couldn't stand by and let them hurt you. Why were they hunting you?
  - What do you mean?
  - Where can I find Visquis?
  - I was glad to help. You better head out before you run into any more trouble.
- Man on the right
  - I can... in exchange for some information.
  - Tell me about the Refugee Sector.
  - The Jedi didn't do this... the Sith did.
  - Why are the refugees here?
  - **I'm looking for a Jedi Master by the name of Zez-Kai Ell.**
  - **I am a Jedi.**
  - I will do what I can, but that may not be enough.
  - What can you tell me about the bounty on Jedi?
  - Any idea why they posted a bounty on Jedi?
  - Where would I find someone connected to the Exchange?
  - I'll be going now.
  - And what do you get out of it?
- other man
  - Of course. Here, take five credits.

  - Does your pessimism run that deep?
  - I... will consider what you have said. `a_influence_inc(6, 1)`
