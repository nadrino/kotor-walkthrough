- Back to admin
- Kreia joins
  - **Enemy?**
  - **Wait - who is this enemy?**
  - Then let's go.
- Level up Kreia
- Siths are following you (don't attack yet)
- HK-50
  - Atton, there's no time to explain - grab a weapon, and follow me.
  - **No, you were clear, I just don't listen to assassin droids.**
  - **Whatever you say, "murder" still means "murder" to me.**
  - So you mimicked the maintenance officer's voice to control the droids and kill all the miners in the medical bay?
  - And so you ordered the mining droids to kill me?
  - **Why did you want to capture me?**
  - You found me. Obviously I didn't do a good job.
  - **Who is this client of yours?**
  - So what now? Are you going to kill me?
  - Enough of this - you won't take me without a fight.
