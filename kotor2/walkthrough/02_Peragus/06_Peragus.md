    - Kreia joins
        - Enemy?
        - Wait - who is this enemy?
        - "We?" There is no "we" here.
        - Then let's go.
    - HK-50
        - Atton, there's no time to explain - grab a weapon, and follow me.
        - No, you were clear, I just don't listen to assassin droids.
        - Whatever you say, "murder" still means "murder" to me.
        - So you mimicked the maintenance officer's voice to control the droids and kill all the miners in the medical bay?
        - And so you ordered the mining droids to kill me?
        - Why did you want to capture me?
        - You found me. Obviously I didn't do a good job.
        - Who is this client of yours?
        - So what now? Are you going to kill me?
        - I don't want to fight you, but I will if you leave me no other choice.
