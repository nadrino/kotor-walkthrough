## Meeting the Jedi Council

- Immediately pause after the conversation with Bastila
	- Take of you armor/sword/helmet -> take your original closes
- Follow Bastilla (Carth too)

- You are stopped by a Jedi
	- **Are you a Jedi?**
	- I believe you are mistaken. I am not a Padawan. I am Name. I came here with Bastila.
	- **I didn't come here to be scolded by you!**
- Go to the council room (left)
- Speek to Carth
- Join the jedi masters
	- **So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?**
	- **Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?**
	- **I've got some questions for all of you.**
	- **Why did the Sith destroy Taris?**
	- Me? What about me?
	- **I don't know if I'm ready for this.**
	- **I'm willing..**

> The council wants to talk in private. You leave the discution, and go to bed.
> In the meanwhile you have a new vision...

- Carth speaks
	- **I had a rough night...**
	- Did she say anything else?
	- Let's go.
- Take Mission in the group
	- Level Up
- Move forward -> auto suggestion with Mission
	- **Malak will pay for what he did, Mission.**

- Go to the consil -> SAVE -> Start cinematic and discution -> reload -> remove party member (for the en of the cinematic)
	- **What?? How would Bastila know if we shared a dream?**
	- I am having visions now?
	- Are you saying I'm... joined with her?
	- **I will try my best.**
	- **Jedi are turning to the dark side?**
	- **I'm ready now. I accept this mission.** (otherwise DS -> should I ? -> sevral more dialogs -> not much sense -> they talk about visiting the ruins) 
	- As you wish, Master Vandar.
- Jedi Training begins

- Discussion with Zhar
	- **I want to ask some questions, Master Zhar. Questions about Revan and Malak.**
	- What happened?
	- What happened to this noble mission?
	- I will heed the lesson, Master Zhar.
- Remove Carth and Mission in the party -> does not make sense
- Go to the jedi masters -> Bastilla will redirect you to ask the masters
- Dorak
	- **Where are the Academy's archives?**
	- Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.
	- **What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?**
	- **They should have protected them!**
	- Did the Jedi join in?
	- **How did Revan fall to the dark side?**
	- **Where did they disappear to?**
	- **How did Revan get so many followers?** (other question good also -> new lines)
	- So what happened next?
	- **What can I learn from Revan's history? -> less but more coherent**
- Vandar
	- I'd like to ask you some questions.
	- What can you tell me about Bastila?
	- Carth mentioned something about it.
	- Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
	- Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?
	- //Master Vrook doesn't seem to like me very much... -> NO LATER -> Can't finish discution coherently when becoming padawan otherwise
	- Quit
- Vrook (quit the conversation at each question... He really does not want to talk!)
	- I would like to ask some questions.
	- What can you tell me about Bastila?
	- Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak? (re-ask)
	- What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan?
	- You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you? (re-ask)

> On XBox you should have the Calrissian's Utility Belt in Carttis inventory if you used the mod. (TODO: put the link!!)
> This item is gonna be necessary latter to trigger more dialog options.
>
> On the original version of the game on XBox (and XBox One), this item can't be aquired anywhere in the game.
> However, the item in itself is present in the game. 
> It seems like Bioware added this item but forgot to check if it was buyable before the release on PC.
