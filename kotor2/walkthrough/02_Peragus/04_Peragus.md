- Meet HK50 (all in one go)
    - **How do you know me? I'm not your Master.**
    - **Who was your previous Master?**
    - What happened?
    - For a droid, you don't take orders too well. Now tell me what happened.
    - How come I don't remember any of this?
    - **Incapacitated?**
    - Drugged?! What do you mean drugged?
    - So I wasn't sealed in the cargo hold - someone locked me in.
    - But how did I get from the Harbinger to here?
    - **Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?**
    - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
    - **Bounty?**
    - But why would that ship have taken me off the Harbinger?
    - How so?
    - **Why would someone want me captured?**
    - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
    - **That information wouldn't have been in coreward databases... only in Jedi archives.**
    - Potential hostiles?
    - I see... go on.
    - Then what happened?
    - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
    - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
        - Are there any left alive?
        - **Then I need to get in there to rescue them. (LSP)**
        - Can we try to contact them using a comlink?
        - **Satisfaction?**
        - We don't know what happened to them, so we need to find out.
        - **Those miners could be hurt or in danger - we need to make sure they're all right. (LSP)**
        - I'm your Master, and I'm giving you an order to assist me.
        - This just keeps getting better and better. Who's got the damn code?
        - If you have the code, then give it to me.
        - **Voiceprinted?**
        - But you do know the code.
        - **Leave "condescending" out of your speech conditionals from now on, or else.**
        - So how can I bypass this voiceprint?
        - I had some other questions for you.
    - What are you?
      - **Veiled threats?**
      - What's a translation droid doing on Peragus?
      - What have you determined?
      - I never said you were coming with me.
      - I had some more questions for you.
    - Have you seen a T3 unit?
      - The unit was last seen near the hangar.
      - Then maybe you can answer something else for me.
    - How can I get into the hangar bay again?
      - What's that body there?
      - Screams?
      - Wait - if you can play back his voice, can't you speak the voice code?
      - Believed to possess?
      - [Persuade] The fact you can mimic voices is pretty impressive. What would it sound like if you did speak the code to the console?
      - Can you follow me and say that again?
        - {Doesn't make sense} Looks like I'll need to find some way to carry your voice there - or record it.
      - No, I had some other questions I wanted to ask you.
