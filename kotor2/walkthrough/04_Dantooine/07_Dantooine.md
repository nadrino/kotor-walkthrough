Assault
- Grenn
  - **There isn't anyone else that can rally the settlers?**
  - Could you tell me about the squads?
  - Main entrance.
  - The back - by the garage.
  - Inside by the administrator's door.
  - I'll take the front. `the more merc you can kill, the more XP you get`
  - Do I have time to do anything else?
  - Have you talked with the men?
  - [Persuade] I think they could use some encouragement. Maybe I could speak to them.
  - [Persuade] Tell them this is their chance to make history. `c_sc_per_gt(15)`
    - Dantooine's short history has been a constant tale of rugged people surmounting difficult odds. Never have the odds been so great, or the future so uncertain...
    - ... But today is your chapter, your tale. Generations yet born will look upon the upcoming battle with pride and wonder...
    - ... I will not lie, the risks are great. The threat real, but I would stand beside any one of you proudly as we face our destiny on this field of battle...
    - ... This is our day, our valiant chance to free Dantooine. Who will fight beside me?
- The battle starts
