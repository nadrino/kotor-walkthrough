## Go to Tatooine

- Take and level up Canderous (15) and Mission (14 to 15)
- Level up -> Mission equip with Chundar Bowcaster
- Czerka -> Griff
	- **// I’m not giving you the gland until I see some credits!**
	- Here's the tach gland. Take it.
	- You already promised me a few thousand credits.
	- **I've done more than enough for you already!**
	- **I don't need business advice from you, Griff.**
- Talk to Mission (Griff gone)
- Renvoyer Mission pour Zalbaar -> non trop chaud pour Z -> HK
- Go to the dune sea
    - Kill Wraids? before and after the talk? (still 300PX each)
- Dunes (SAVE) -> 1800XP + XP du suicide lol !! sinon 50 +30 +30 en kill c’est tout
	- You talk too much and do little.
	- I think you both need to calm down.
	- Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?
	- You sent your own men to die, Canderous?
	- **[Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.** HARD
	- He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.
	- No!

- Kill rodians
- Talk Canderous -> need time
- Go near the big truck -> assault of sand people
- Kill Wraids (still 300XP * 4) but a lot easier
- Level Canderous + HK (16)

- Behind dune 
- Sand people -> kill -> easy with stasis
- -> droid -> kill

- Hunter lodge -> sell wraids 24c -> no, Yavin? -> does not make sense...
- Ebon
	- Canderous -> ask again
	    - What are your thoughts now?
    - Jolee (7/8)
        - So when did you go to Kashyyyk?
        - The Jedi just let you go?
        - **With good reason, I imagine.**
        - So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?
        - You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?
        - Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?
        - So you crashed... and stayed?
        - How did you survive in the Shadowlands?
        - It couldn't have been easy.
        - You're completely insane, you know that?
        - And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?
        - You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.
        - You helped them?
        - Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?
        - It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.
        - A few bruises?
        - Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?
        - You spent two decades living like that?
        - The Wookiees?
        - **You sound quite fond of them.**
        - Gardeners?
