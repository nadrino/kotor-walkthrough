- If needed: use workbench and lab of Khoonda
- Grenn
  - I'm ready to finalize the battle plans.
  - I'm certain. I've done all I can.
- Assault
  - Grenn
    - **There isn't anyone else that can rally the settlers?**
    - Could you tell me about the squads?
    - Main entrance.
    - The back - by the garage.
    - Inside by the administrator's door.
    - I'll take the front. `the more merc you can kill, the more XP you get`
    - Do I have time to do anything else?
    - Have you talked with the men?
    - [Persuade] I think they could use some encouragement. Maybe I could speak to them.
    - [Persuade] Tell them this is their chance to make history. `c_sc_per_gt(15)`
      - Dantooine's short history has been a constant tale of rugged people surmounting difficult odds. Never have the odds been so great, or the future so uncertain...
      - ... But today is your chapter, your tale. Generations yet born will look upon the upcoming battle with pride and wonder...
      - ... I will not lie, the risks are great. The threat real, but I would stand beside any one of you proudly as we face our destiny on this field of battle...
      - ... This is our day, our valiant chance to free Dantooine. Who will fight beside me?
- The battle starts
- Save during the battle sometime the script doesn't work
- Zheron say you need to back off
- Azkul
  - Why do you want her dead?
  - You can still back away.
- Kill everybody
  - "The Jedi"? It was just one Jedi, actually. And I am considered an outcast by other Jedi.
  - I am happy to help.
  - **[Take the 4000 credits] That will do.**
- Vrook
  - What happened to the Jedi?
    - Like on Katarr?
    - Why did you come to Dantooine?
    - But if you can mask your presence here, couldn't the other Jedi?
  - Why are you in hiding?
    - So why are you here?
    - How would they have had access?
    - Did you find any presence of the Sith on Dantooine?
    - [Awareness] But that is not the only reason you came to Dantooine. `c_sc_awa_gt(10)`
  - The Sith have revealed themselves. `make more sense now, "you are no Jedi, you cannot feel the force"`
    - They exist. They have already attacked me.
    - I do not know - they believe me to be a Jedi.
  - Where are all the Jedi?
    - Where are these other Jedi?
    - But how can you contact each other?
    - And what then?
    - I want to talk about something else.
  - I need to know why you cast me out of the Order.
  - At the end of my trial, you and the other Masters said something had happened to me. What was it?
    - I heard it in a holo-transcription of my trial.
    - [Persuade] Don't you think I have a right to know? `c_sc_per_gt(11)`
  - Why did you cut me off from the Force?
    - Then what happened to me?
    - But I have reestablished my connection to the Force.
  - Do you know anything of Force Bonds... and how to end them?
    - Yes, and the connection is lethal.
    - But I have reestablished my connection to the Force.
  - I'll be going now.
- Teaches form `a_learn_return(2)`
  - { (5) Shien form - Vrook draws his lightsaber and fences with the player, demonstrating the form}I'm only going to demonstrate this once. This is the Shien form, a defensive stance that's good when you're outnumbered - which is most of the time.
- Loot
- Dopak
  - What will you do now?
  - Thank you for joining me in the battle. Your aid made the difference between success and defeat. `a_lightsml()`
- Zheron
- Save before leaving Khoonda


After the assault
- HK-50
- Tarn -> still complaining!
