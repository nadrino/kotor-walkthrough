- Go to the jedi masters -> Bastila will redirect you to ask the masters
- Dorak
	- **Where are the Academy's archives?**
	- Very well... tell me the history of the Jedi.
	- **What does this have to do with Revan and Malak?**
	- **They should have protected them!**
	- Did the Jedi join in?
	- **How did Revan fall to the dark side?**
	- **Where did they disappear to?**
	- **How did Revan get so many followers?** (other question good also -> new lines)
	- So what happened next?
	- **What can I learn from Revan's history? -> less but more coherent**
- Vandar
	- I'd like to ask you some questions.
	- What can you tell me about Bastila?
	- Carth mentioned something about it.
	- Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?
	- Are you saying Revan was responsible for Malak's fall?
	- //Master Vrook doesn't seem to like me very much... -> NO LATER -> Can't finish discution coherently when becoming padawan otherwise
	- Quit
- Vrook (quit the conversation at each question... He really does not want to talk!)
	- I would like to ask some questions.
	- What can you tell me about Bastila?
	- Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak? (re-ask)
	- What happened on the Outer Rim to corrupt Revan?
	- You often seem angry with me, Master Vrook. Have I displeased you? (re-ask)
