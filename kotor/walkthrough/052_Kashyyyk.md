	- I trust …
- …

	- Go over exactly what happened with Zaalbar.
	- So Zaalbar was exiled. When did you learn the truth?

- +675PX
- Go to Star Map
- Get mines
- Talk to the hologram
	- What is your purpose?
	- What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?
	- And I don't fit that pattern?
	- That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?
	- Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?
	- I want to ask questions about you and this installation.
	- Who built this installation in the first place?
	- If this place was built 30,000 years ago it predates the Republic.
	- Why was agricultural reformation needed?
	- That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.
	- …
	- Who installed this holo-interface?
	- Who last accessed this installation?
	- Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.
	- But there was an entry at some time?
	- Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?
	- …
	- What's the current function of this installation?
	- Defense of what?
	- 
	- I want to go back to my general questions.
	- What limitations have been placed in your programming?
	- What gaps are missing?
	- 
	- I seek information about a Star Map.
	- Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?
	- What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?
	- How can I match them when I don't know what they are?
	- What do you mean by that?
	- What if I fail? (not on XBox)
	- You may begin evaluation.
	- 
	- How did you know Zaalbar's name?
	- Can I confer with someone else?
	- **I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he. -> Wrong but LS**
	- Then I will change my answer.
	- Continue your evaluation then.
	- I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.
	- **I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.**
	- **The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people. + 2LSP**
	- I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.
	- **I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.** + 2PCL

            - **Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.** -> makes no sence
        - **Have you spoken to him?**
        - **A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.**
        - **Just?**
