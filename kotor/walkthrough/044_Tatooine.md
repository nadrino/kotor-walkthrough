- Go to the droid shop (SAVE -> before the door)
- Yuka Laka
    - What do you have available in your shop?
    - Let me ask a few questions about HK-47.
    - What does the HK-47 designation mean?
    - What functions have you tested?
    - _What does the HK-47 designation mean?_ (again)
    - Where did you get this HK-47? (Carth speaks)
    - //You don't seem to know much about it.
    - Let's get back to my other questions.
    - Goodbye.
- Inspect Droids and HK-47
    - **I'm not familiar with Systech Corporation. What else do they make? -> better informations here**
    - Why are you keeping information to yourself?
    - Access to your memory is restricted?
    - How do I know you'll be loyal once the restraining bolt is removed?
    - Why would you assume that?
    - Doesn't Yuka question you about your reluctance to reveal your functions?
    - **Let's go back to my previous questions.**
    - Sell yourself, droid. Why would I need you?
    - **So you translate? I understand most languages well enough.**
    - Why would you be better than an armored battle droid?
    - **You are beginning to sound like an assassin.**
    - You don't sound very convincing.
    - **All right, I'll see about purchasing you.**
    - Does Yuka Laka know you talk about him like this?
- Yuka Laka -> SAVE (don't overwrite previous)
    - Let me ask a few questions about HK-47.
    - You don't seems to know much about this droid
    - Why haven't you wiped its memory?
    - I'm interested. Let's talk price.
    - Could I convince you to lower the price a bit?
    - Despret to sell ?
    - Perhaps I can convince you to go lower?
    - [Persuade] Come now, think of the advertising you'll get from me. (Medium 50%)
    - 2500c (if fails -> reload last save or 3000c proposed -> go back to the door save)
    - Thanks, goodbye.
- HK-47
    - **Kill something for me?**
    - Travel with me now.
- Replace T3 with HK
- Level up HK (7 to 11)
- Retalk Yuka -> HK-47 Intervention !
    - //Buy Heavy Plating Type 2 -> 1500c **NOOO ! Will be looted in Enclave of Sand People !!!**
    - Buy a Stun Ray arm if not aquired already
    - Equip HK with sonic Rifle (Stun Bonus)
- Go to Iziz the Jawa (with Carth and HK)
    - **Could you be clearer? I'm having trouble understanding you.**
    - Why wouldn't I understand your true language?
    - **What is it that you want, Jawa?**
    - **HK-47, can you help me out here?**
    - **What about the other 2%.**
    - So, Iziz, what do you want me to do?
    - Tell me about where your people are. Maybe I'll help.
    - A few more questions, all right ?
    - **Tell me about "those who came before". (Carth trouve le temps long…)**
    - I'll check it out when I leave the city. Goodbye.
    - (Replace HK with Bastila)
    - **I'm looking for something called a Star Map. Can you help? -> IMPORTANT !**

    - Improve light sabers
    - Speak ?
    - Juhani (personal 2/9) -> later on Switch? -> wait for level 13
      - Are you doing alright?
      - **You're too fragile, Juhani.**
      - Perhaps you just need more time.
      - **If I see you begin to slip back, I will intervene.**
    - Juhani (personal 3/9) -> personal story -> Later on Switch/PC?
        - What are you thinking about?
        - **And how are things different now?**
        - We are all in this together.
    - HK-47
        - I would like to know more about your functionality.
        - I thought you said that removing your restraining bolt would restore your memory?
        - So you lied to me.
        - How can you not know parts of your functionality?
        - Are you damaged?
        - Tell me what you can, then.
        - An assassin?
        - Err… I won't tell anyone.
        - Is there any way to reactivate that function?
        - **Is there any way to repair you?**
        - So I can restore your memory?
        - So you're saying your memory might just… come back?
        - So how do I go about restoring part of your memory?
        - **I would like to try restoring some of your memory. (Repair 8+)**
        - Are you implying I am inept?
        - I happen to be very good at what I do.
        - Let's get started.
        - **Yes, let me hear it.**
        - Why can't you identify his acquaintance?
        - **This man needed a bodyguard?**
        - You mentioned this Systech Corporation when I purchased you.
        - This man… is he still alive?
        - **You killed your own master?**
        - Wait… tell me about this assassination protocol.
        - **Why not?**
        - **Why didn't he just deactivate you?** -> Most interesting
        - And that's when you killed him?
        - **I don't think he was as lucky as you think.**
        - Didn't they know what you had done?
        - What a horrible story!
        - I'm just glad I acquired you myself.
        - Are you sure this actuator can't be fixed?
        - Did you recover any other memories?
