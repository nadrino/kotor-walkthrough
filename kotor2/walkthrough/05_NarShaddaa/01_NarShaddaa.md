- Conversation in the Ebon
  - **So there's lot of ex-soldiers on Nar Shaddaa?**
  - How hard would it be to find a Jedi here?
  - What's the Refugee Sector?
  - [Awareness] You sound like you've been here before. `c_local_set_aw(30, 3)`
  - What's Nal Hutta?
  - // How hard will it be to hide here?
  - Then let's take the Ebon Hawk in for a landing.
- Cutscene with ship above the planet -> GO-TO

`TO FIX: texture of Hanhar`

- Introduction of people who will try to get you!
- Arrival on Nar Shaddaa
  - Is this the Refugee Sector?
  - Any problems with the docking authorities?
  - Are we going to be okay on this landing pad?
  - // The Ebon Hawk looks a little exposed. `DONT, prevent some banters < yes`
  - **Then let's move on.**
    - I'm just looking for a place to lay low.
    - I wouldn't mind getting some new equipment.
    - I want to find out more about this bounty on Jedi. `Visas + Disciple want to help for the Bounty`
    - If Zez-Kai Ell is here, I want to find him.
    - Let's see where our path takes us.
  - It's a landing pad - ships land on it.
  - What other ship?
  - Junk? You're lucky my ship's gracing your trash heap.

- Take Atton & HK? T3/Bao will have some banters later
- 2 thugs are mugging a refugee
  - What's going on here?
  - Exchange business? That's why I'm here.
  - I've come here to meet with the Exchange. The two of us have business.
  - Tell your employers that <FullName> has come to Nar Shaddaa to meet with them.
  - Why does the Exchange care what happens to this man?
  - I won't let you hurt that man. Stand away from him. `a_lightsml()`
- Kill the thugs
- Talk to the Refugee `Wrong head with voice...`
  - I couldn't stand by and let them hurt you. Why were they hunting you?
  - What do you mean?
  - Where can I find Visquis?
  - I was glad to help. You better head out before you run into any more trouble.
- Man on the right
  - I can... in exchange for some information.
  - Tell me about the Refugee Sector.
  - The Jedi didn't do this... the Sith did.
  - Why are the refugees here?
  - **I'm looking for a Jedi Master by the name of Zez-Kai Ell.**
  - **I am a Jedi.**
  - I will do what I can, but that may not be enough.
  - What can you tell me about the bounty on Jedi?
  - Any idea why they posted a bounty on Jedi?
  - Where would I find someone connected to the Exchange?
  - I'll be going now.
  - And what do you get out of it?
- other man
  - Of course. Here, take five credits.
  - It may help him - if nothing else but to survive.
  - Does your pessimism run that deep?
  - I... will consider what you have said. `a_influence_inc(6, 1)`
- left where the door is already openned
- Mira appears
- Lupo
  - Is he okay?
  - You the owner of this... establishment?
  - I am <FullName>.
  - Rare, how so?
  - **I'd like to place a bet.**
  - Myself to win. [odds 100/1]
  - 1000 credits.
  - What did you do?
- Talk again
  - Finances?
  - What droid?
  - **That's not fair!**
  - You're right, I'm sorry. {LS} `a_givelight(1);a_local_set(47)`
- Borna Lys
  - Greetings, I'm <FullName>.
  - I was thinking of racing my swoop bike.
  - And why is that?
  - Droids do not frighten me.
  - What does this have to do with a droid?
  - **Droids aren't all that tough.** `HK-47 banter`
  - **So by not fixing the races anymore, the Exchange couldn't claim a cut of the winnings?**
  - So then why is this place empty?
  - **That's disgusting.**
  - So he got too greedy.
  - So how do I beat him?
  - Just tell me what to do.
  - So how does that help us?
  - What's in this for you?
  - How should we proceed?
  - What good will that do?
  - Great, what are the codes?
  - [Computer] I can reprogram the computer behavior core with a process delay without him realizing it. `c_sc_com_gt(14)`
- Conversation with HK-47 `TODO: MOVE HERE -> talk about "observing you"`
- Open door
- Modo So
  - Mark?
  - Can I race?
  - Anything else I need to know?
  - Other swoop bikes?
  - Fan blasts?
  - Never mind.
- Nobodo
  - It is.
  - What do you see?
  - Why do you say that?
  - Is this your way of asking me for a handout?
  - **But if the city is so beautiful, why would you want to leave?**
  - Why is it you can't win the races then?
  - Perhaps you are not approaching this situation from the right direction.
  - A droid?
  - Fan blasts?
  - Thanks for the tip, maybe someone can even the odds.
- Guron
  - What are you looking for?
  - You're looking for such a device here?
  - Which means?
  - Why would other swoop bikes be a problem?
  - Backwards?!
  - Unless?
  - Does such a device exist?
- Check the droid in the cage
  - [Awareness] Check the droid for oddities.
  - [Computer] Hook the module up to your datapad. `c_sc_com_gt(15)`
- Retry
  - [Computer] Slice into the droid's central behavioral core `c_sc_com_gt(5)`
  - :: Open file "Swoop0001" ::
  - [Computer] Reprogram the droid.
  - [Persuade] Your droid seems to have... expired.
  - I believe your droid had a minor malfunction.
  - Perhaps someone can buy the gallery from you.
  - That Twi'lek female in there seems to be interested for some reason.
- Race any time should be fine
  - _Congratulations! You are the new swoop champion! Your time was <CUSTOM55>. The second place finisher was Nodobo with a time of <CUSTOM51>._
  - Thank you. Is there a prize?
  - I appreciate it. Perhaps I will see you again.
  - +500c
- Borna
  - +2000c
- HK `Atton will comment`
  - Vulnerabilities?
  - **Mercy and charity are not weaknesses.** `a_influence_dec(5, 1);a_givelight(1)`
  - Why are you studying me for vulnerabilities?
  - What, to protect me?
  - You don't have to call me master.
  - There is no "illusion" of control. You answer to me.
  - What do you mean, "the end?"
  - Nothing nevermind.
- Thugs
  - How much does he owe?
  - You two better back off before you're kissing duracrete.
- Kill the two guys
- Rutum
  - I can handle them. For now, I need some information.
  - I'm looking for a Jedi Master by the name of Zez-Kai Ell. Heard of him?
  - I'm looking for bounty hunters.
  - That's better than nothing
- HK comments `a_influence_dec(5, 3)`
- Geeda
  - What do you mean, "veteran of a war yet to come?"
  - You're pretty articulate for a Rodian.
  - So you spend a lot of time around humans?
  - // Let's see what you have.
- Kreia
  - I... I feel this background noise, like a vibration.
  - It feels so alive, but with a desperation about it.
  - But the anger and desperation... is there some way to heal it?
  - I'm not interested in manipulation, but healing.
- Ondar `Atton Banter`
  - Schutta?
  - If she's hurting your business, maybe I could talk to her, reach a compromise.
  - I'll do it. Now let's see what you have.
- Door behind, kill the thugs
- Ratrin Vhek `Atton bantten`
  - What makes you think the ship's yours?
  - If you can prove the ship is yours, I'll give it back to you.
  - That's right, but I didn't know about the cargo hatch.
  - You're not taking the ship.
- Vossk `Banter with Mira?`
  - Is that a threat?
  - And why is that?
  - Forget it. I had other questions for you.
  - You sound as if you hate the guild.
    - Forget it. I had other questions for you.
  - You mentioned the guild had laws.
    - What laws do they uphold?
    - So if they were all hunting one person, they couldn't attack each other?
    - Who are some of the prime bounty hunters?
    - Gand?
    - Who else?
    - I can handle them both. Anyone else?
    - Hanharr?
    - What about Mira?
    - Why?
    - Forget it. I had other questions for you.
  - So you are no longer a bounty hunter?
    - Can you tell me where I can find the guild?
    - What can I do to make them show themselves?
    - That doesn't sound very comforting.
    - So who should I make mad?
    - Wookiee?
    - Forget it. I had other questions for you.
  - I am being hunted. I need to know by who.
    - I was hoping to find out without it coming to that.
    - Never mind. I'll be going now.
- Next room, entrance of workshop
- Unlock container
- Change group: Bao + T3
- TT-32
  - 32nd model?
  - Explosive ends?
  - I'm looking to buy some equipment.
  - I'll be going now.
- Tienn Tub
  - Are you all right?
  - I... came here to do business.
  - Depends. What is this place? `Bao comments`
  - Can you change a ship's ID transponder codes?
  - I can pay you for your time.
  - Can I use your workbench?
  - Never mind. I'll be going now.
- TT-32 ask when you leave
  - What happened to him?
  - What would you like me to do?
  - Plans? What plans?
  - They aren't dangerous, are they?
  - If I can get a free version of that part once it's built, then I'll do it.
  - What does the droid look like?
  - Where can I find Kodin?
- Droid
  - You don't look too good.
  - **What were you doing on a scrap heap?** `T3 banter`
  - What is your function?
  - Are you Tienn Tubb's droid?
  - I need your memory core.
  - It won't hurt, I just need to pry it out. You can be fitted with a new memory core.
  - I'll speak to Kodin.
- Kodin
  - This little droid's a good slicer. You'd need a lot of credits to buy him.
  - I was just kidding. The droid's not for sale.
  - **Leave the droid alone, or else.**
  - Who are you?
  - Why would I be interested in junk?
  - I'm looking for an astromech droid - IT-31, once belonged to Tienn Tubb?
  - That droid there seems to know what I'm talking about.
  - Save yourself some pain and give the droid to me.
  - How about I buy that droid from you?
  - [Awareness] I have a feeling you'll be satisfied with 150.
  - Fine. I'll return the droid to Tubb.
- Droid
  - I negotiated your release.
  - You're free to go - see you back at Tienn's garage.
  - What was that all about?
  - Don't play innocent with me.
- Back to workshop
  - Good to see you made it back all right.
- TT-32
  - Just so you know, I have a copy of the schematics of that part.
  - If I hadn't retrieved the droid, you wouldn't have anything.
  - If you don't have any credits, then give me some of your parts.
  - Very well. I'll be going now.

- Back to the Ebon
  - Atton, T3, HK, PC cutscene
    - What are you playing?
    - Can I play?
    - Republic Senate rules?
    - Deal me in.
  - Play the game
  - Cutscene T3/HK
- Loot in the hidden compartment
- HK
  - And how is that?
  - I am not proud of what I did during the Wars - and I do not wish to discuss it. `a_influence_dec(5, 1);a_givelight(1)`
  - Are you trying to provoke me?
  - Why did you ask me about the Mandalorian Wars?
  - What do you mean?
  - **That's a very human perspective.**
  - How is that?
  - Don't attempt to justify my actions - or yours. `a_lightsml(1);a_global_set("000_HK47_Good_Retort", 1)`
  - Interrogation?
    - It's not an interrogation, I just want to ask you some questions.
    - Enough with the interrogation already. When I ask you questions, I mean I will ask questions without torturing you.
  - You look a lot like a series of droids that have attacked me.
    - Well, there's at least four other now defunct versions of you in the galaxy.
    - Actually, there's a series of HK-50 units sharing your model and function that we have encountered on multiple occasions.
    - Are you all right?
    - I wanted to talk about the other HK units.
        - Do you know where these clones are being created?
          - But how did this happen?
          - What was that? It sounded like a malfunction.
          - Are you sure you don't know where they are striking from?
          - And how would this information come out if it was locked in your memory core?
          - I need to know more about these clones of yours.
        - Why do you need me?
          - What are you talking about?
          - That doesn't explain why you need me.
          - I need to know more about these clones of yours.
        - Do you know why they are hunting me? `Atris leaked the info of you being a Jedi`
          - What do you mean?
          - Why would someone do that?
          - Who?
          - I need to know more about these clones of yours.
        - Why are they masquerading as protocol droids?
          - [Computer] So a good portion of your programming was adapted from protocol subroutines? `c_sc_com_gt(9)`
          - What do you mean? `Atton will comment`
          - [Awareness] Do any of these "incidents" have any wider repercussions? `c_sc_awa_gt(18)+c_ac_int_lt(17)` -> same line as intelligence
          - **Why did you say that just now?**
          - The echo - why did you say that? `Revan has discussed of "echo" before`
          - What repercussions did Praven Prime have?
          - And that's a good thing?
          - But why are the HKs masquerading as protocol droids?
          - **Those are typical droid duties, but it doesn't mean they should be treated as furniture.** `a_influence_inc(8, 1) if t3 is around. otherwise, dec on T3 even if no there` 
          - Actually, I'd like to know.
          - Why did the Sith go to war with the Republic?
          - **I need to know more about these clones of yours.**
        - Why did they start revealing themselves now?
          - I need to know more about these clones of yours.
        - You sound pretty disgusted by these duplicates.
          - I get it, already.
          - They really don't seem that different from you, actually.
          - From the voice? But you all sound exactly the same.
          - Okay, so that explains your anger.
          - I had other questions.
      - Do you know anything about the Sith hunting us?
        - Any idea where they might be striking from?
        - You can say that again.
        - **I picked up a sonic imprint sensor on Peragus - it doubles as a translator.** `HERE IS WHY!`
        - Why?
        - Here you go.
        - I'm not sure I'm going to like what you're about to tell me.
        - Can you use it to track them?
        - What should we do with it?
        - Then we should destroy it.
        - I'm not for standing around here, waiting for them to hit us again.
        - So we just wait?
        - I had some other questions.
      - For a sophisticated assassin droid, you don't seem as advanced as you should be.
        - I had some other questions.
      - I found the navicomputer tampered with. Any idea why it's locked?
        - Yes, it's voice-printed.
        - You can mimic languages, right? Can you unlock it?
        - I had some other questions.
      - How did you get scattered all over the galaxy?
        - It was something of a pain, yes.
        - I had some other questions.
      - Who was your previous master? `!c_influence_bet(5, 30, 70)`
        - I'm not sure I understand.
        - Memory problems?
        - What's the last thing you remember?
        - Why?
        - Are you all right?
        - Whiny?
        - Uh... right.
        - I had some other questions.
      - Nothing, never mind. `!c_influence_bet(5, 30, 70)`
        - Well, you may not like the answer, but go ahead.
        - Yes. I thought everyone in the galaxy knew that.
        - I don't understand.
        - Like I'm your mother?
        - Were you created on Malachor V?
        - What targets were you assigned?
        - Why did Revan consider the Republic not a threat? `FAIL !c_influence_bet(5, 20, 80)`
        - Which side did you fight on?
        - That doesn't answer my question.
        - We are not having this discussion right now.
      - +1000 XP
- T3
  - [Repair] Maybe some advanced maintenance is in order. `!c_influence_bet(8, 30, 70)`
    - [Repair] Lock your motivators and unlock the side panel. `!c_sc_rep_lt(21)`
    - [Due to your repair skills, T3 has become tougher and faster, gaining +1 Dexterity and +1 Constitution.]
    - No, I'm fine. I guess I just caught up in my work.
    - I had other questions for you.
  - [Computer/Repair] Do you mind if I try working on you one last time? I keep feeling like there's something I'm missing. `!c_influence_bet(8, 10, 90)`
    - All right, then. Be still, calm yourself.
    - [You have gained +1 Wisdom and recovered part of your connection to the Force, learning a moving meditation to calm the mind.]
    - Yes, I'm fine - I feel calm, collected.
    - No, I'm fine... really. Let me ask you some questions.
  - I want to practice my moving meditation I learned on you.
    - I'll wait until you're damaged then, then try and fix you.
  - +2500 XP
- Kreia
  - Yes, and I need some answers.
    - If the Council cast you out, how come Atris and none of the Jedi Masters mentioned you? `!c_global_eq("000_Kreia_Revan")+!c_global_gt("000_Jedi_Found")`
      - [Awareness] You're lying. `c_sc_awa_gt(10)`
      - Do you use that technique on me?
      - I still think you're lying to me - and you haven't told me everything.
      - Never mind. I'll be foing now.
  - // I want you to teach me more about the Force.
    - Before, when I heard the thoughts of my companions, I heard something, like an echo. `NEED LVL 20`
    - What do you mean?


- Geeda
  - Oondar across the way has a problem with you.
  - That is acceptable.
  - I'll be going now.
- Oondar
  - Geeda offered me a discount, too. If you want her gone, you'll need to raise your offer.
  - You haven't given me anything yet, except words.
  - Your threats don't mean much.
  - I'll go take care of business, then.
- Geeda
  - Oondar countered your offer with a threat from the Exchange.
  - [Awareness] You're trying to tell me something else. You're testing me. `c_sc_awa_gt(9)`
  - I'll choose the longer road. Oondar was irritating me, anyway.
  - And what do I get out of it?
  - I already settled the problems on Dantooine. If you want to travel there to trade, you can.
  - I will do my best and let you know.
  - +1000 XP
- Oondar
  - I'm standing with Geeda...

- Next loot unlock
- Next Bith Scientist
  - I am <FullName>, just checking out the area.
  - Can I ask what you're doing?
  - [Repair] You've got an impressive array of equipment and monitors here. `c_sc_rep_gt(5)`
  - [Repair] This equipment looks like it's designed to track signals - correct? `c_sc_rep_gt(5)`
  - Antennas for what?
  - Tracking a signal among the dock frequencies seems impossible.
  - I don't understand.
  - Why is it a problem?
  - [Wisdom] Why would anyone need such a strong signal? `c_ac_wis_gt(15)`
  - How did you find it then?
  - Who is behind it?
  - Is there anything I can do to help you out?
  - What's the job?
  - I'm interested.
  - Where were you supposed to meet this Twi'lek?
- Lasavvou
  - I'm not from the dock authority. What do you mean?
  - Let me see if I can help. I'll go see the dock master.
  - [Awareness] Out of curiosity, what is your cargo, Lasavvou? `c_sc_awa_gt("7")`
  - Could I have one of your power cells?
  - I'll let you know what happens.
- Lootra
  - Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here.
  - What do you mean?
  - Why can't you get into the Refugee Sector?
  - How do you know she's still alive?
  - I may be able to get into the Refugee Sector for you.
  - Nothing - I'd just like to help, if I can.
  - Let me go see what I can find out in the Refugee Sector.

- Fassa
  - I wanted to talk to you about the Exchange.
    - Can you help me infiltrate the Exchange?
    - Where can I find Vogga?
    - I want to talk to you about Lasavvou.

    - What can you tell me about Goto?
    - What's Vogga's problem?
    - Why doesn't Vogga do something about it?
    - What's your interest in this?
    - I was also trying to find a fuel source for Citadel Station.
    - Not after I convince Vogga it's safe for his freighters to operate again.
  - Guard
    - Who are you?
    - I want to speak with Vogga.
    - The freighter hijackings that have been plaguing his shipping.
  - Vogga
    - I wanted to know about the Exchange.
    - What has Goto done to you?
    - Perhaps I can help you get to the bottom of this.
    - Citadel Station is looking for a new fuel source.
    - If I can take care of Goto, will you agree to ship fuel to Citadel Station?
    - I just want to make sure Telos has fuel.
    - I don't take orders from pompous slugs.
    - I'd like to talk to you about the fuel on Sleheyron.
  - B5-D8
    - Can you tell me anything about Vogga?
    - What is this place?
    - You buy droids?
    - I'll be going now.
