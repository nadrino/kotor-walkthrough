## North Part of the Temple

- Massive door in front is locked
- Start by going on the left (north) (suggested by the path of a droid)
- First door -> one Sith -> loot -> leave
- Corridor with the sea on your left -> 2 droids
    - Take Juhani to kill the droids with her power
- First door on the right -> droid + sith -> loot
- Second door on the right -> same -> but there is a door in the back! -> Come back first
- Computer room
    - View South Security Computer Room.
        - [Computer] Overload computer power conduit. (+400PX + kill PX)
    - View Armory exterior.
        - **[Computer] Unlock armory security door**. (+300PX)
    - // Other options are either no XP giving or no very useful (regarding the spikes cost)
- Go back to the previous room -> open the back door
- Meet 2 sith guards
    - I am Revan no longer. I serve the light and the Jedi Council now! (+2LSP)
        - Take the other choice for DSP
- Room on the right: Sith Master -> kill
- Back door is the armory -> should be unlocked
- Loot everywhere
- Improve LS of Jolee or Juhani
    - Equip the updari crystal just looted on your red LS (replacing droid bonus -> Juhani handle them)
- Go on the other room (where were the sith guards)
- 2 Deadly mines in front of the stones! -> equip belt + helmet + gaunlets
- Loot the Sapith crystal (krayt perl like -> go to the workbench replace it in the violet LS) -> reequip
- Next door on the left -> droid room -> loot everywhere -> good equipment for droid
- Restore (fully) the rusted droid. Don't forget to equip repair belt -> +1300PX
- Reequip the Nerve Amplifier belt
- Follow the droid -> he will enter the room with the 2 droids w/ shields!
- Take Juhani to help kill the droid (should be quite easy)
- Loot the room -> +5000c great (can we still spend some credits at this point?)
- The droid open the next room which leads to the catacombs

## The Catacombs

- You get directly agressed by 2 droids -> Juhani
- Left room mines in front of a stone again
- + chest with a datapad in it explaining the puzzle -> walk in a shape of an H on the pads to open the door
- Get mines + crystal (Sapith)
- Next room -> open
- next -> walk on the pads -> H shape
    - the first pad is off, your H should start on the next pad which is the bottom right of "H"
    - Walk like you wanted to draw a "H" (back and forth when its needed)
- End solo mode
- Talk to the computer
    - You recognize me?
    - Your database?
    - Tell me about the Star Forge.
        - What do you mean?
        - ...
    - Do you know anything about the Star Maps?
        - They didn't do a very good job of destroying them.
        - ...
    - Tell me about the history of the Infinite Empire.
        - The plague?
        - ...
    - How can I shut off the disruptor field around this planet?
        - How can I get to the upper levels of the temple?
        - ...
    - I'm looking for genetic data on the Rakata.
    - I'll be going now.
- Go back upstairs


## South Part of the Temple

- Continue your previous path on the right
- Next door -> one Sith -> it's the medical room -> loot
- Door on the right (from the entrance POV) -> 2 turrets -> Juhani
- Cut the locked door
- It's the "prototype droid command room"
    - The computer is useless for us since we already killed the prototype droids
- Take the door on the left of the computer -> 4 droids -> place where Bastila was tortured!
- Go back and open the other door on your right -> one droid -> loot
- Open the last door -> guide you back to the medical room
- Take the corridor near the sea -> 2 droids
- First door on the right -> 1 sith
- Second door -> same
- Next door -> computer room where you remote killed the sith (and a droid through the door in the previous room)
- Alright ! You made a full round!
- Next door on the right -> 2 droids -> ramp up -> open door!
