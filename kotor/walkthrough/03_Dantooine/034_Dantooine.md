	- **Why Vrook doesn't like me?**
- Take Carth (with Bastila)
- **Matale enters** Carth -> lines with matale
	- **Is there anything else I should know?**

	- I shall investigate this immediately.
- Level UP Bastila (8 to 10) + Equip gauntlets (Strength)
- Talk with Bastila
	- I want to talk about that dream.
	- I still don't understand why we shared this 'vision'.
	- But how did our fates become linked?
	- **Well, thanks a lot.**
	- I have another question.
	- Why did we dream of Malak and Revan?
	- **What do you mean by a 'trace'?**
	- **What do you think Malak and Revan were doing?**
	- **I'm not sure I like the idea of you being in my dreams.**
	- **Pretty certain, yes.**
	- Do you think we will receive more of these visions?
	- That's all I wanted to know.
