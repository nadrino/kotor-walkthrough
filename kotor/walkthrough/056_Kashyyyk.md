- Freyr
	- I have a few questions about Kashyyyk, Freyyr.
	- What will you do about the slavers?
	- I think it's time I was leaving.
	- That would be fitting, I think.
- (+6LSP) -> now close to full LS!
- Zaalbar + Jolee (Bastila + Jolee -> no trigger for banther)
- Levelup Zaalbar (14)
    - Equip him with Bacca's ceremonial Blade
- Go back à pied -> kill Czerka
- EBON


## Back to Ebon

- Improve Zaalbar sword
- Canderous (6/6)
	- Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.
	- How much did you lose?
	- And you eventually came to Taris.
	- **Opponents who could easily kill us.**
- _Could improve HK (14 repair) there instead of before_
- Zaalbar
	- Have anything more about..
	- Bacca’s Sword ?
	- Sorry can’t stay more ?
- Jolee (can't start the conversation for now)
	- Ask for med
- Juhani -> ask about Canderous ! **Very rare option!** 
    - _if you made Juhani interact with Canderous like told in this guide, you should have it._
    - _Don't do the 5/6 discussion before, otherwise this line will be deleted_
        - I was wondering if we could talk.
        - **Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?**
        - He has proven himself well.
        - You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.
            - **Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.** -> makes no sence
        - **Have you spoken to him?**
        - **A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.**
        - **Just?**
        - **I think you will come to trust him in time.**
        - **About what?**
- Carth
	- Do you want to talk ?
- Go to Yavin
