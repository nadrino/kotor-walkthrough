# Bastilla Joins

	- We were trying to find you, remember?
	- **Both of you settle down! This isn't helping.**
	- Okay, so what now?

	- Something weird happened when we first met. Like a vision.
	- Of you. Fighting a dark Jedi. Revan, I guess.
	- Force sensitivity? What do you mean?
	- This isn't the first time I had a vision.
