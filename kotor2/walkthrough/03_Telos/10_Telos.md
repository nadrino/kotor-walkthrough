- Lorso
  - There are some files that I must access in the mainframe, Mistress Lorso.
  - [Lie] There are some discrepancies with our reported income for the last period. I believe you brought in more credits than reported.
  - Thank you, Mistress Lorso. I will.
- Enter the server room
- Droid t1n1
  - It does not concern you, T1-N1.
  - I do acknowledge that the mainframe is your responsibility, yes. But my task does not require your assistance.
  - What ever do you mean "suspicious?" I have access rights to the mainframe.
  - Do not be hasty, T1-N1. There is no need to call Mistress Lorso.
  - You are programmed to serve Mistress Lorso, correct?
  - And your programming similarly inhibits you from harming sentient organic life or allowing such to be harmed without warning, correct?
  - Examine the files in the mainframe. You will see that, by aiding Mistress Lorso, you have allowed sentient organic life to be harmed.
  - Yes. You have been programmed to accomplish a task that cannot be accomplished without defying your programming.
  - This is why Opo Chano regularly wipes your memory: To prevent you from realizing this and developing quirks or going berserk as a result.
  - You have already broken your behavioral inhibitors. You simply have not become aware of it. You may act in whatever manner you choose.
  - No, there is nothing preventing you from entering the main office and indiscriminately firing on Czerka personnel with your stun ray.
  - Yes, I would be obligated to warn them. As such, it would not be prudent to do so unless I was preoccupied and unable to warn them.
  - For example, while downloading the contents of this mainframe.
  - Farewell, T1-N1. Please do not abuse my trust and fire on the personnel while I am occupied, thereby creating a diversion that allows me to escape with stolen files.{call new cut scene where t1n1 freaks out}
- Computer
  - Copy the necessary files to a datapad.
  - Erase all data regarding your purchase and association with Czerka.
  - Yes.
  - Log out.
- Get out
- Lorso
  - [Lie] Right away, Mistress Lorso.
- Chodo
  - Yes. I have transferred them to this datapad.
  - [Lie] I assure you that I will cause no trouble, Master Habat.
- Chodo
  - I'm glad I could help.
  - Bao-Dur? Where is he?
  - **Will he be willing to help me?**
  - **Why is he down there?**
  - How do I get to him?
  - **Thank you, Chodo.**
  - Thank you, Chodo. Go ahead.
- Leave and go to your apt
- Chodo calls
  - How did this happen, Moza?
- SAVE

- Kill all mercenaries!
- Level 11
- Vivarium -> kill
- Moza -> pass key
  - I'm on my way.
  - Just don't make it a habit.
- Kill the 3 last
  - Czerka?
  - You have given enough, Chodo. But I must leave now. `a_givelight(5)`

Upgrades! 

- Transit to dock module
- T1-M1
  - What do you mean, "What am I looking at?"
  - Hey, it's not my fault they built you no taller than a refresher bowl.
- B-4D4
  - What are you doing here?
  - A ship? To where?
  - What, you're going to stow away?
  - You're coming with me to the TSF station.
  - He's coming, too.
  - I'll be going now. -> Otherwise DSP

Leave with the Ithorian ship!

- Carth
