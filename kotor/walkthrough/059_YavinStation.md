- Back to Ebon
	- Jolee (0/8)
		- Why did you decide to come with me?
		- So you wanted a ride on my ship?
		- No, seriously, tell me.
		- Is this a comment on my breath?
		- I never heard of him.
		- You're making all of this up!
		- How young are we talking?
		- Andor killed Kraat, I take it?
		- You're kidding…
		- But how can you even be sure Andor was responsible?
	- Juhani (5/6) (level 16)
        - I was wondering if we could talk.
        - What happened after your father died?
        - What happened?
        - Did she die?
        - You were enslaved?
        - And they freed you?
        - What was the dream?
        - You became a Jedi.
    - Bastila (8/9) (or 8/8 without a mod that fixes the last conversation)
        - When we last talked you said you needed time to think. So?
        - Yes, I think so.
        - **What is it supposed to be like?**
        - Are you interested in me or in my ability to use the Force?
        - **You could leave, if you had to.**
        - …
        - So what does this mean for us?
        - So that's it? It's all over?
        - Great - you learn a lesson and I get dumped!
        - **So I was just a stepping stone to you becoming a Master?**
        - Difficult for you? What about me?
        - I'm going to stop Malak, Bastila. But I want to do it with you at my side.
        - You know I'm right, Bastila.
        - **I love you Bastila. And I know you love me.**
        - It didn't feel wrong to me.
- Go to Manaan
