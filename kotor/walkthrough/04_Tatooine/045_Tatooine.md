- Marlena Venn
	- What do you mean by "you old boys"?
	- Anniversary gift? What are you talking about?
	- Um, all right? What if he has a message for you?
	- You sound like you're planning to kill him.
	- I have to go.
- Jedi support all group member
- Go toward the garbage slight right
- Ambuscade ! -> Astuce : always stun 
	- Very tough… -> all firepower on one guy
- See the 3 guys
	- I would assume this was done by the Sand People?
- Easier here… but 3 groups. Take Bastila to manage her force powers -> stay near the group
	- I've agreed to try and stop the Sand People attacks.
	- Do you know anything about the Sand People?
	- The Sand People are using turrets?
	- I have other questions about the desert.
	- I have to go.
- Go on the right of the big truck
- Sand people ambush ? (2nd) -> or later
- Kill Wraids one by one (there is always 4 so if you see less, some are hidden)
- Kill Sand People Group near the south path (easier but respawns! -> throw grenade ? kill the grenade thrower first)
- Récupérer les déguisements
- Disable mines (//equipment rappel : Bothan Sensory Visor (+immunity coups critiques) + Stabilizer Gauntlers)
- Ambuscade Gamoreans
	- And if I refuse to pay you anything?
	- Perhaps I could persuade you not to do this?
	- Who are you to threaten me? I could be dangerous.
	- That’s it.
- Kill all
- 3 mines around their setup
- Save/Reload -> Wraids will respawn! (550px each! x4) -> level up (13) with the last one
- Next debris -> ambush ? (2nd on XBox)
- Go near next garbages -> Ambuscade (3rd or 4th)
- Tanis
- Talk to a droid before
- Talk to Tanis - recognize you (HK and Bastila will intervine)
	- What happened here?
	- You sit back and let your droids do the hunting?
	- It just doesn't seem very sporting.
	- Why would she do this?
	- You don't seem too concerned about what triggered this.
	- What do you want me to do?
	- All right, I'll try and help out. Hold on.
- Start with droid “A”
	- Playback: A special message from Marlena.
	- Status of total Battle Droid group.
	- Get system specifications.
	- Previous system options.
	- **Access system status and repair functions.**
	- **Enter diagnostic mode to try manual repair.**
	- **Node 2 is reporting accurately.**
	- Exit.
- Droid B
	- The missing value is 7.
- Droid C
	- Allocate 120 large pulses.
- Droid D
	- 31-13-12-14 * 23-41-12-14
- Tanis
	- That will be fine
- Go to the previous mines path
- Disguise
**SAVE**
