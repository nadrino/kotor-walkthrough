# Court

- Interpellation
	- What? Why?
	- …
	- Get me out of here!
	- Arbiter?
	- I don't need anyone to represent me!
	- What have I been charged with?
	- It's all the Sith's fault!
	- How will you get me free?
	- **I had authorization to enter.**
	- I have no prior association.
	- Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?
	- How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?
	- **I think I'd rather represent myself.**
	- No, I'll represent myself.
	- …
	- Not guilty.
	- **I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.**

## Show proof to Shaelas

- Replace T3 with Jolee (level up to 15)
- Talk with Jolee (4/8) -> Talk the MAXIMUM !!! -> 8 before the leviathan !!!
  - Why did you leave the Jedi?
  - You did. You said you weren't a Jedi any longer.
  - So are you a Jedi or not?
  - So you're just some rogue Jedi. Big deal.
  - I certainly don't think that.
  - So the Jedi wronged you in some way, I take it?
  - **Is this going to have a point?**
  - **And? I don't get it.**
  - So... you knew this Master Hortath? Or the Padawan?
  - I don't understand...
- Shaelas (Jolee + Bastila intervine)
    - I have information for you, Shaelas.
    - The Sith are training the Selkath youth in the ways of the Dark Jedi.
    - I've convinced your daughter to turn her back on the Sith ways.
    - I hope so.
    - **Keep your credits, Shaelas. A Jedi has no need of such rewards.** +2PCL sinon 500c -> PCL vont être important…
- 2 LSP + 600 PX
- Elora (SAVE)
    - [Persuade] Was Sunry having an affair? 
        -> NEED SUCCEED -> otherwise fail -> Jolee saves -> but NO XP -> in fact ok (patch on XBox ?)
    - He has killed many Sith before.
    - Don't worry... I’ll save him (other already)
- 500 PX


- Open prison door -> closed
- Talk to selkath -> unlocked
- Sunry (Jolee interviene)
	- There's a few things we have to clear up.
	- The judges said you left after the shot was fired.
	- There's a few things we have to clear up.
	- There was a Rodian who planted evidence at the murder scene.
	- I know you're guilty, Sunry. I've got the Republic's data recording.
	- But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?
	- **I don't know.**
	- Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!
	- These are just excuses, Sunry. We both know you have to own up to your crimes.
- 500 PX
- Talk to other prisoner
- SAVE
- Selkath Warden
	- **I want to begin Sunry's trial now.**
	- Yes, let's begin the trial.

	- **I will find Sunry innocent.**
	- (Firith Me)
		- Objection, your Honors!
		- **Did you actually see the murder happen?**
		- **Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?**
		- **Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?**
		- I have no additional questions.
		- (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut
	- (Gluupor)
		- **Did you see Sunry kill Elassa?**
		- **Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue?**
		- **Did you plant the medal on Elassa?**

		- (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut
	- (Sunry)
		- **How could Elassa have got a hold of your medal?**
		- **You were going there to end the affair. Would the Sith object?**
		- I have no additional questions.
		- (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut
	- (Closing)
		- **No one actually witnessed the murder.**
