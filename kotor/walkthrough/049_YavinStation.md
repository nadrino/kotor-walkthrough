- Take Canderous ? -> make sense -> With Carth ? Unfinished Banter
- Level up Carth (12+13) + equip him with Calo armor (or keep for you and Carth take the davik one)
- Bug played pazaak -> Black screen Xbox -> played then -> return -> save/reload -> retalk -> debug
	- Yeah, I'm new. Very new.
	- **[Lie] I do work for Davik.**
	- I work for the Republic.
	- Trandoshans and smugglers? What are you talking about?
- Reask
	- I'm trying to defeat Darth Malak.
	- He is the Dark Lord of the Sith.
	- When I... acquired the Ebon Hawk, it had the coordinates for your station.
	- I seek the pieces of a map to a 'Star Forge'.
	- Exar Kun?
	- What have you heard about the current war?
	- **Enlighten me about Exar Kun.**
	- **You spend all your time here in this station? Alone? -> last time can ask him**
	- **Why did you come here to the station?**
	- Who are the smugglers?
	- Who are the Trandoshans?
	- Why are they here?
	- Do you have anything you'd be willing to sell me?
- **Sell race bonds** : 156 instead of 60 !! (_https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/556553-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/44235516_)
	- 120*156 > 18k !!
- Pazaak -> 10*750cr max -> il est nul sur XBox EASY -> discount !
- Buy ?
	- Light Exoskeleton -> cher et pas si ouf
	- Bargwin ? -> better pendant les missions de contrebande : (_https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Genoharadan#Genoharadan_)
		- Améliorable -> Stealth + 8 max (et armor 9 improved)
	- **Advanced Stabilizer Gloves** -> YES best gands pour les perso à distance ! -> Pour Canderous
	- Implants ++ ? -> not interesting + unusable now
	- Baragwin Droid Shield -> pas compris… ?? -> en fait juste un shield pourri -20 dégâts energy mais en illimité
- Equip Canderous with gloves -> No! not Canderous -> Max dexterity bonus cap from Light Battle Armor -> Better on Carth with Davik's armor
- Speek to Carth (6?/12)
	- Tell my why you want revenge on Saul so badly.
	- It just seems to be more… personal than that, is all.
	- I do, if it's alright with you.
	- That's terrible, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
	- I didn't mean to pry.
	- What was she like, your wife?
	- So this is where all that anger comes from.
	- **So what happened to your son? You didn't say.**

## Back to Ebon

- Juhani (3/6) - (level 14) -> before on Tatooine
	- Is something wrong?
	- I am sorry, Juhani.
	- **I do not remember seeing any of your race on Taris…**
	- **How could such a government last?**
	- **Decent humans are hard to find.**
	- Your parents?
- Juhani (personal 3/X) -> personal story -> on Switch. Too late?
	- I was wondering...
	- What are you thinking about?
	- **And how are things different now?**
	- We are all in this together.
- Juhani (personal 4/X) -> later on Yavin? -> NO??
  	- I was wondering...
	- What are you thinking about?
	- I know some parts are bad, but...
	- Humans can be just as cruel to each other.
	- Wait a second. Why are you telling me all this?
	- No, it is alright. I will be here to listen to you whenever you want.
		- _next personal story will unlock after a new level is acquired_ -> level 15
- HK (14 repair) -> LATER!!
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let’s get started.
    - What now?
    - That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?
    - **Don't you care about all those lives lost?**
    - //? But you *have* killed on your own accord before.
    - So another master gone because of you.
    - No doubt.
    - You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?
    - You would have been found out eventually.
    - I should dismantle you!
    - How very self-sacrificing of you.
    - Do you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.]
- Star Map -> Dantooine


## Back to Dantooine

- Go out alone
- Buy -> LATER
	- Calrissian's Utility Belt ? -> On Xbox need a patch to deploy bezfore arriving there!
- Stowaway
  	- Go ahead...
	- There is a stowaway on my ship by the name of Sasha.
	- Yes, I am. She only speaks a smattering of Mandalorian, but I was able to figure it out.
	- Certainly. I'll bring you to my ship.
	- Lur Arka na bads. Nuh-gisen laesfa, Sasha.
- Equip the belt -> HK (17 repair) -> Later
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let's get started.
    - What? Why not?
    - Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
    - You are eager to find your origins, are you?
    - Well…
    - So tell me about this last owner, then.
    - **It appears no one could resist using your protocol.**
    - I suppose I would, at that.
    - Oh? Why is that?
    - So you killed *that* master directly.
    - You are just a travelling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
    - You don't want to hear the answer to that.
    - So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
    - So can you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.]
- Go to star map -> Kashyyk
