- Talk to Sith Suddent
    - **They're all dangerous.**
    - Why don't the Sith do something about it?
    - Where did it get all these droids?
    - This droid went insane, you say? -> SOUND SUPPRESSOR!!!
    - Are you going inside?
    - Thanks. I'll be going.
- Equip Juhani with Sealth belt (GenoHaradan +8) (Mission might have it equiped -> change group in menu to get back the belt)
- Enter (SAVE)
- Don't step on any mine!! -> demolition sensor for Juhani
- Kill the 2-3 firsts droid with Juhani + verpine blaster (solo mode) -> other remains in the back!!
- Juhani solo -> kill all droids with powers -> avoid mines
- Sealth to open the door
- Droid welcome you
    - You are... the 'master' the droids kept referring to?
    - Why aren't you attacking me like the others?
    - You are programmed to kill but don't want to?
    - How is it that the Sith haven't found you here?
    - How do I know this isn't some kind of trick?
    - You... appreciate the value of life?
    - What kind of assistance do you want?
        - And if I refuse?
        - What's the catch?
        - And what do I get for helping you?
        - Very well. I'll do it.
    - What happens if I make a mistake?
        - How hard is it to re-initialize the sequence?
