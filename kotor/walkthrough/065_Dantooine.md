## Go to Dantooine (LAST TIME)

- Go out and take HK and Zaalbar
- Buy
    - Calrissian's Utility Belt ? -> On Xbox not present -> need to have put a mod when first loaded this area!!
    - Equip -> 17 Repair
- HK -> last memory
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let's get started.
    - ...
    - What? Why not?
    - Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
    - You are eager to find your origins, are you?
    - Wellâ€¦
    - So tell me about this last owner, then.
    - It appears no one could resist using your protocol.
    - I suppose I would, at that.
    - Oh? Why is that?
    - So you killed *that* master directly.
    - You are just a travelling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
    - You don't want to hear the answer to that.
    - So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
    - So can you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.]
- Go to Matale's Mention -> Speeder
    - [Slice into the speeder and activate its alarm system.] [1 spike]
    - I don't know who set off the alarm. I was just passing by.
- Kill -> Then auto stop
    - You must pay for your crimes, Zuulan.
    - That's a small price to spare your life.
    - I can't just let you go. You are a slaver.
- Transit back
- Back to Ebon
  - Jolee (5/8)
    - What do you know about the Sith?
    - You must know more than that.
    - You're being elusive on purpose.
    - You did. You said you fought them.
    - **Are these the same Sith that we're fighting now?**
    - Who is this Exar Kun?
    - And he was killed?
    - **So tell me what you know about the Sith.**
    - **What happened during the war with Exar Kun, then?**
    - But you exterminated all the traitors, right?
- SAVE
  - Go to Tatooine
  - (can't go to Kashyyyk : meet Bandon too soon)
