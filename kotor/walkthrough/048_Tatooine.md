	- How did they redeem themselves?
- Juhani (personal 4/X)
    - What are you thinking about?

	- **You can do that?**
	- And why would he do that?

- Bastila (5/8)
    - You look like you have something to say.
	- Is that a compliment? From you?

	- Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.
	- Maybe, but you don't need to be like that.
	- **We could be more than friends, Bastila.**
