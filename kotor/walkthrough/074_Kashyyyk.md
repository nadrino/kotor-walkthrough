- Talk to Juhani (personal 8/9)
    - I regret any of the harm I may have caused.
    - You will do fine, Juhani.
- Zaalbar
    - How do you feel...
- HK-47
    - So... you belonged to Revan originally?
    - **I doubt you could have done anything.**
    - Don't talk about Bastila like that!
    - Am I very much like the Revan you knew?
    - Do you know anything about the Star Forge?
    - What can you tell me of Malak?
    - So... why the 'meatbag' references?
    - So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.
- Canderous
    - What are you throughts now?...
    -
    - //Tell me about when you worked for Davik. (later)
    - **You were an assassin?**
    - **A wise decision.**
    - **Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.**
- Mission
    - I just wanted to talk. About me being Revan.
    - So it doesn't bother you at all?
