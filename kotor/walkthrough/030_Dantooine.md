- Go to the council room (left)
- Speek to Carth
- Join the jedi masters
	- **So you've drawn me into your little trap, Bastila. What now?**
	- **Isn't the Jedi Council on Coruscant?**
	- **I've got some questions for all of you.**
	- **Why did the Sith destroy Taris?**
	- Me? What about me?
	- **I don't know if I'm ready for this.**
	- **I'm willing..**

	- Are you saying I'm... joined with her?
	- **I will try my best.**
	- **Jedi are turning to the dark side?**
	- **I'm ready now. I accept this mission.** (otherwise DS -> should I ? -> sevral more dialogs -> not much sense -> they talk about visiting the ruins) 
	- As you wish, Master Vandar.
- Jedi Training begins



- Discussion with Zhar
	- **I want to ask some questions, Master Zhar. Questions about Revan and Malak.**
	- What happened?

	- What can you tell me about Bastila?
	- Carth mentioned something about it.
	- Is there anything you can tell me about Revan and Malak?

> On XBox you should have the Calrissian's Utility Belt in Carttis inventory if you used the mod. (TODO: put the link!!)
> This item is gonna be necessary latter to trigger more dialog options with HK-47 (a droid you buy on Tatooine).
>
> On the original version of the game on XBox (and XBox One), this item can't be aquired anywhere in the game.
> However, the item in itself is present in the game. 
> It seems like Bioware added this item but forgot to check if it was buyable before the release on PC.
