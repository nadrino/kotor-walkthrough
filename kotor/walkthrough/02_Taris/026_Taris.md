## Preparing for the Race

- Improve Carth Blasters
- **Talk with Carth (4/12)**
  - I want to continue our discussion from before.
  - Don't you think you'd feel better if you discussed it?
  - That name sounds familiar.
  - **How could you have not seen through that?**
  - Do you really believe that?
  - **I'd do the same thing in your shoes.**
- Go back to the lower city with Carth and Mission
- Level Up Carth (7)
- **Buy enough repair parts (8 needed)**
- Go to the last lower city apartments -> in front of the elevator door
  - Start on the left
  - Repair the droid
  - Open the door -> kill one Vulkar
  - Loot, next door -> kill 4 Vulkars
  - Loot, next -> again
  - Mission levels up (7)
  - Next door -> Musicians -> Twisted Rancor
    - Activate Elinda first.
    - Activate Ujaa second.
    - Activate Ujii third.
    - Activate Loopa fourth.
    - Activate Fodo fifth.
    - Activate Ashana sixth.
  - Equip Carth with the Echani armor
  - Next door (be careful to 3 Vulkar walking in the corridor)
  - Bounty Quest : Permacrete Detonator
    - What are you doing in here? This place looks abandoned!
    - [Persuade] Are you in some sort of trouble? Do you want to talk about it? (Easy)
    - Maybe there's some way I could help you out if this mess.
    - Maybe you could fake your own death?
    - Tell me your plan and I might help you out.
    - I could get you a permacrete detonator.

- Go to the Swoop race -> Hidden Bek base
  - I have the accelerator right here.
  - Okay, I lived up to my end of the deal. Now you better come through!
  - Zaerdra's right, Gadon. One of your own riders should get that swoop bike.
  - Sounds like you've got all your bases covered.
  - Suddenly I'm not so sure about this.
  - Okay, I'm ready for the race.


## Swoop Platform

- Talk to everyone
- See Bastila

- Do the race two times

- Brejik will interfere
  - You better not be trying to cheat me, Brejik!
- Kill all Vulkars and then Brejik
- Level up (8)
- Loot Brejik -> Light Saber and belt, gloves
- Talk w/ Bastila
  - **It's a long story.**
  - I've got somewhere safe to go. I was planning to take you there after I saved you from Brejik.
  - **I think you've got things confused. You were a helpless prisoner until I came along.**
  - **Hey, who said you were in charge here?**
  - Carth and I are already working on a plan to get off Taris. (or other... -> but this one is logic with next)
- You have this strange dream again...

- Bastila
  - We were trying to find you, remember?
  - **Both of you settle down! This isn't helping.**
  - Okay, so what now?
- ... transition only you with her
  - Something weird happened when we first met. Like a vision.
  - Of you. Fighting a dark Jedi. Revan, I guess.
  - Force sensitivity? What do you mean?
  - This isn't the first time I had a vision.
