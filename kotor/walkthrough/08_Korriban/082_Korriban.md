## The Sith Academy

- Sith Trainer ask you questions
    - I know that the Sith are powerful. A force to be reckoned with.
    - And what of my companions?
    - I am ready to learn more.
- Loot in your room
- Go see Yuthura Ban (in the next room)
    - Your favorite prospect?
    - Absolutely.
    - What's so important about this tomb?
    - +500PX
    - You want me to kill Master Uthar?
        - **What's to stop me from telling him about this?**
        - **And what's your part in this?**
        - How do I know this isn't some test?
        - Very well. I agree.
        - +500PX
    - How do I get more prestige?
        - Yes, go on.
        - Yes, go on.
    - Can you tell me about the Code of the Sith?
        - +125PX
        - 'Peace is a lie, there is only passion'?
        - 'Through passion, I gain strength'?
            - What about love?
            - Those seem like awfully negative passions.
            - Are you saying we aren't anything more than a rudimentary creature?
            - The Jedi say the opposite. How can both be right?
            - I see.
        - 'Through strength, I gain power'?
        - 'Through power, I gain victory'?
        - 'Through victory, my chains are broken'?
            - You don't think the Sith'ari can exist?
        - 'The Force shall free me'?
        - I think I got it.
    - I want to know more about these ruins on the surface.
        - Is there any way into the tomb of Naga Sadow?
        - There's no other way inside?
        - Why are the Sith so interested in these ruins?
        - I've heard enough.
    - **What do you know about Darth Revan?** (after Leviathan)
        - That's the one.
        - Do you think it's possible Revan might be alive?
        - **So you wouldn't recognize Revan if the two of you met?**
        - You mentioned that Revan came here before?
        - That's all I have to ask.
    - Tell me about yourself.
        - You mentioned you were from Sleheyron... -> LATER
    - I'll be going.
