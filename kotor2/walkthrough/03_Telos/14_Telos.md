- Party
  - What's with T3?
  - You did what while you were connected?
  - You downloaded Atris' archives?
  - He said there was a holo record of my trial in Atris' records.
  - I came because I chose to, not because you summoned me.
  - If you seek to punish me, then get on with it.
  - Those last few moments after my trial... I had no idea.
  - I know it could take a while, but keep analyzing her archives.
  - In a second - what else was in the archive?
  - What about artifacts? Lightsabers?
  - She was obsessed with records. Why wouldn't she have a list?
  - That was a rhetorical question, sorry.
  - All right then. Play the missing Jedi.
  - MOD
    - **What happened to the other member of the concil?**
    - **So they're dead. But five of the Jedi who were on the Council that exiled me are still alive.**
      - KREIA: And we are walking into it. This is too convenient **to be anything but a trap.**

Lightsaber!
- Bao-Dur
  - Atris and the Jedi Council took it from me.
  - Do you think I can't build one?
  - With the Jedi enclaves all destroyed, I don't know where to get the parts.
  - **Since when did you become an expert on lightsabers?**
- Atton & T3 then Bao
  - Utility droids tend to have a habit towards developing personality quirks.
  - That sounds like a good idea to me.
  - [T3-M4 has received a permanent +2 bonus to his Constitution.]
- SAVE

- Start with discussing with Bao
