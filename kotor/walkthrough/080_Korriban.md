    - Who are you?
    - How do you know about the Ebon Hawk?

    - How does someone get to the ruins?
    - So how does someone get into the academy?
    - Have you ever heard of a Star Map?
    - Yes, but much older. Perhaps in the ruins?

    - Davik's dead, I presume. I stole the Ebon Hawk from him.
