The Search for Bastila - The Lower City
=======================================

- (Visit the military base door)
- Go back home
- **Talk to Carth (1/12)**
    - Is this a good time to ask you some more questions?
    - I just would like to know you better.
    - This isn't an interrogation. I never said that.
    - Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.
    - I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.
    - **You'd rather I wasn't?**
    - Are you implying *I* had something to do with the crash?
    - Why would Bastila request my transfer?
    - I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.
    - Are you always this suspicious?
    - I consider this important.
- Equip you (not carth, conversation with the sith will not make sense) with the Sith armor

- Go back to the elevator with the uniform (by foot ! -> funny talks)
- _(Don't talk to everybody since Carth is with you... -> Does not make much sense)_

    - I'm not looking for a fight. I just want to talk.
    - Okay, I see your point. I'll be off then.
- Go see Holdan in the music room -> wait for force persuade with Bastila to pull off Dia's bounty (+4PCL 125XP instead of 50+105?)
    - Who are you?
    - You work for Davik?
    - You're pretty open about what you do.
    - Do you think Davik could get me off Taris?

    - That's weird: a Twi'lek who speaks galactic Basic!
