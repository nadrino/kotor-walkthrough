- HK50
    - How do you know me? I'm not your Master.
    - Who was your previous Master?
    - What happened?
    - Why don't you tell me anyway?
    - How come I don't remember any of this?
    - Incapacitated?
    - Drugged?! What do you mean drugged?
    - So I wasn't sealed in the cargo hold - someone locked me in.
    - Fine - what happened next?
    - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
    - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
    - Bounty?
    - But why would that ship have taken me off the Harbinger?
    - How so?
    - **Why would someone want me captured?**
    - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
    - That information wouldn't have been in coreward databases... only in Jedi archives.
    - Potential hostiles?
    - I see... go on.
    - Then what happened?
    - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
    - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
        - Are there any left alive?
        - **Then I need to get in there to rescue them. (LSP)**
        - Can we try to contact them using a comlink?
        - Satisfaction?
        - We don't know what happened to them, so we need to find out.
        - **Those miners could be hurt or in danger - we need to make sure they're all right. (LSP)**
        - I'm your Master, and I'm giving you an order to assist me.
        - This just keeps getting better and better. Who's got the damn code?
        - If you have the code, then give it to me.
        - Voiceprinted?
        - But you do know the code.
        - Leave "condescending" out of your speech conditionals from now on, or else.
        - Fine. Now tell me how to get off this rock.
        - I had some other questions for you.


- HIM
    - What are you?
    - Veiled threats?
    - What's a translation droid doing on Peragus?
    - What have you determined?
    - I never said you were coming with me.



- T3?
    - Have you seen a T3 unit?
    - The unit was last seen near the hangar.
    - Then maybe you can answer something else for me.


- Cadaver
    - What's that body there?
    - Screams?
    - Wait - if you can play back his voice, can't you speak the voice code?
    - Believed to possess?
    - [Persuade] The fact you can mimic voices is pretty impressive. What would it sound like if you did speak the code to the console?
    - Can you follow me and say that again?
    - Looks like I'll need to find some way to carry your voice there - or record it.
    - No, I had some other questions I wanted to ask you.




- Kill all droids
- Kill floating mines with gun
- Console -> voice print -> LATER after Atton Suggest -> but loot
- Back to admin level
- Talk to Atton
    - I found a... talkative... protocol droid down in the fuel depot.
    - No, I thought about it, though.
    - And you can?
    - I need to open an airlock, but it's sealed with a voiceprint protocol by the maintenance officer.
    - It looks that way.
    - I have a sonic sensor and the code - I just need to find the right words to record.
    - The miners may still be alive, they're trapped in the dormitory section.
    - None that I know of.
    - **I'm not leaving them trapped and helpless on this facility. (LSP)**
    - I'll return if I find anything.

- Kreia
    - Just checking to make sure you're all right.
    - As "helpful" as your cryptic warnings are, why don't you find some way to make yourself useful?
    - I keep hearing your voice as I explore this place.
    - Unforeseen consequences?
    - What if it doesn't pass?
    - I don't care... just stay out of my head, got it?
    - All right, then - I'll be back.

- See console med bay -> ID
    - treatments -> check -> attempt -> 34-103
- Security console -> record
- Back to the fuel area
- Console
    - Check ID +100PX
    - Logs -> record +150PX
    - Cameras -> T3!!! +100PX
    - Try repair the com
- Back to HK
    - I found a T3 unit in one of the fuel pipes. It looks damaged.
        - I had some more questions for you.
    - REVIEW THIS PART - HK 50
        - How do I know you again?
        - Tell me everything that happened between the Harbinger and now.
        - For a droid, you don't take orders too well. Now tell me what happened.
        - And where was I when this was taking place?
        - There - you said "locked" again.
        - But how did I get from the Harb...
        - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
        - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
        - And the Ebon Hawk came here?
        - What happened once the ship arrived?
        - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
        - "Unpleasantness?" What are you talking about?
        - Then what happened?
        - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
        - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
            - Are you responsible for all this? (interesting for the plot...)
            - I think you are responsible.
            - Do you know who administered sedatives to the kolto tanks in the medical bay, killing the incapacitated miners?
            - Is that pride I hear in your voice?
            - I had some more questions for you.
    - Enter voiceprint
    - Open inner door
    - loot space suit
    - Open outer door (notice it closed the inner door!)
