## Go to Tatooine

- Take Canderous and HK
- Go to the dune sea
    - Kill Wraids? before and after the talk? (still 350PX each)
- Level up Canderous + HK (15)
- Ambush sand people
- Dunes (SAVE) -> 1800XP + XP du suicide lol !! sinon 50 +30 +30 en kill c’est tout
    - You talk too much and do little.
    - I think you both need to calm down.
    - Why do you need to fight him, Canderous?
    - You sent your own men to die, Canderous?
    - **[Persuade] People die in war, Jagi.** HARD
    - He may have saved other lives by doing what he did.
    - No!

![KOTOR Guide-20](../resources/images/screenshots/KOTOR%20Guide-20.png)

- Kill rodians
- Talk Canderous -> need time
- (if not already) Go near the big truck -> assault of sand people -> still dangerous
- Go toward San People Enclave
- Behind dune 
- Sand people -> kill -> easier with stasis
- -> droid -> kill
    - -> could add frag grenade to bike ? -> no less XP
    - Re-prog droid -> **6 parts needed** with the belt
    - I've reprogrammed your droid, Vorn.
- 1105 PX
- Rather hard to kill -> push++ -> let the droid buffer (if the droid gets killed you can loot back few parts!!)
- -> get data pad

![KOTOR Guide-21](../resources/images/screenshots/KOTOR%20Guide-21.png)

- Back to Ebon -> à pied
- Kill wraids -> level up!! (17)

![KOTOR Guide-22](../resources/images/screenshots/KOTOR%20Guide-22.png)

- Sell sticks at Czerka office
- Hunter lodge -> sell wraids 24c -> no, Yavin
- Ebon
    - Canderous -> ask again
        - What are your thoughts now?
    - Jolee (6/8)
      - Do you want to talk about the war now?
      - **[Persuade] No time like the present? -> easy**
      - Um... no, I don't remember.
      - What does your wife have to do with the war?
      - The war...?
      - And what did she think of all this?
      - So what happened?
      - **So she had fallen to the dark side?**
      - You killed her?
      - But... she was a Sith then, right?
      - They put you on trial?
      - So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?
      - I don't understand...
      - And you still believe love is worth the risk?
    - **Talk with Juhani (6/6)** (level 17) (rare talk since grinding is necessary to reach it)
      - I was wondering if we could talk.
      - Tell me more about your past.
      - **Why would I react badly?**
      - Of course I remember.
      - Well what?
      - Revan?! You mean…
      - Why did you tell me now?
