# Pre Korriban

## Kashyyk - Ebon Hawk (planet you previously chose)

- Talk to Juhani (personal 8/9)
    - I regret any of the harm I may have caused.
    - You will do fine, Juhani.
- Zaalbar
    - How do you feel...
- HK-47
    - So... you belonged to Revan originally?
    - **I doubt you could have done anything.**
    - Don't talk about Bastila like that!
    - Am I very much like the Revan you knew?
    - Do you know anything about the Star Forge?
    - What can you tell me of Malak?
    - So... why the 'meatbag' references?
    - So... Malak was the original meatbag? I like that idea.
- Canderous
    - What are you throughts now?...
    - 
    - //Tell me about when you worked for Davik. (later)
    - **You were an assassin?**
    - **A wise decision.**
    - **Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.**
- Mission
    - I just wanted to talk. About me being Revan.
    - So it doesn't bother you at all?
- Leave the Ebon Hawk -> take Zaalbar and Jolee -> level up (16 to 17)
- Equip Jedi Master Robe to Jolee


- To the shadow lands -> at the south of Jolee's house
- right -> A wookie is dead (he has a datapad...)
- Another wookie is standing near a camp fire...
    - I want to ask you some questions.
    - ... reask
    - According to a datapad I found, Grarwwaar is dead!
    - Your tricks don't fool me, Rulan!
- Try to kill him -> he will transform to monster -> ten Tach -> run away
- Try to find him
- He is at the small cul de sac near Jolee house -> kill 3 monsters -> Tach -> kill -> ok
- Go back to Ebon Hawk
- Go back on Manaan


## Back on Manaan

- Go out alone
- The Twi'lek Ziagrom stops you (makes sence to meet him now)
    - You mean Malak?
    - **I'm not Revan anymore.** (+2LSP)
    - Who are you?
    - You're with the Exchange!
    - Get to the point - how do you know my true identity?
    - **Sources? What sources?**
    - **You're wrong. I'm not in this for revenge.**
    - Let me see these items.
    - I'll check it out next time on Korriban.
- Go see Hulas
    - **How did you know that?**
    - So what happens now?
    - Rulan Prolik is dead.
    - What are you talking about?
    - So when do I get to join the guild?
    - **Nobody plays me for a fool! You'll pay for this, Hulas!**
- +1000PX + GenoHaradan Visor
- -> Challenge in the Dune Sea of Tatooine!
- Back to Ebon
    - Talk with Mission about her brother -> Czerka Office
- Cap to Tatooine!
    - Sith ships attack again


## A last time on Tatooine

- Mission + Carth (level up Mission 16 to 17)
    - Equip Missin with Darth Bandon Armor? -> GenoHara armor will be the best for Mission
- Czerka office
    - Go in direction of the Rodian (shop)
        - What kind of mistake?
        - Did he say where he was going?
        - Good riddance!
    - Talk to Mission
        - Brother
        - **Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.** (+2LSP)
        - So you're okay?
- END OF MISSION'S STORY!
- Replace Mission with Canderous (equip Darth Bandon Armor)
- Go toward the gate
    - Banther
        - Carth isn't like you, Canderous.
- Leave Anchorhead to the dune sea
- 7 people are waiting for you!!!
    - I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone.
    - Three Genoharadan Overseers out of four are dead, Hulas. Time to finish the job!
- Loot every corpse -> good stuff!
- Transit back
    - Canderous
        - Tell me about when you worked for Davik. (not tried...)
        - **You were an assassin?**
        - **A wise decision.**
        - **Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.**
- Go to Korriban!
