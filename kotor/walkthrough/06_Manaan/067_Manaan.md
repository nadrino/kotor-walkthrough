  - You bought Juhani?
  - She is not for sale!
  - There is no emotion…
- Ithorak
    - You don't need to do that. I won't cause any trouble.
    - Personal feelings? Do you mean you don't like Ithorak?
    - Okay, let's go in and see Ithorak.
    - ...
    - My buyer wishes to remain anonymous.
    - Nothing specific. I'm just browsing on behalf of my patron.

- Transit back to the Ebon Hawk
- Jolee (7/8)
    - So when did you go to Kashyyyk?
    - The Jedi just let you go?
    - **With good reason, I imagine.**
    - So that's when you went to Kashyyyk?
    - You survived a crash-landing on Kashyyyk?
    - Why didn't you just fix your ship and keep going?
    - So you crashed... and stayed?
    - How did you survive in the Shadowlands?
    - It couldn't have been easy.
    - You're completely insane, you know that?
    - And the Wookiees didn't mind your presence?
    - You seemed on fairly peaceful terms with them.
    - You helped them?
    - Why didn't you stop the slavery of the Wookiees, then?
    - It sounds like you enjoyed being a god.
    - A few bruises?
    - Wasn't it all a bit primitive for you?
    - You spent two decades living like that?
    - The Wookiees?
    - **You sound quite fond of them.**
    - Gardeners?

## Sith Base

- Leave the Ebon Hawk with T3 and Bastila (14->15)
- Last door of the Corridor to take the Shuttle (behind Deadeye)

> Taking the shuttle is the 3rd alternative way. As both interrogating the prisoner
> and hacking the passcard is out of date, it is more logical this way. 

- Kill -> easy -> monter dans navette

    - Water room -> kill all

        - Commander Hasek:
            - In regards to the system in place to cycle water from the ocean to the thermal heaters:
            - What were you thinking?!? What made you put that airlock mechanism on the only other path to the north side of the base?? Now everyone has to know how to cycle the water out of one room and into the adjoining one for each of the three rooms in sequence without accidentally flooding the room they're in. We lost seven troopers just this week!
            - Next time I'm there you better show me how to do it properly! I can't afford to lose any more of my aides while trying to get to the Selkath!
        - Adjutant:
            - Sorry, sir, but we had to change the pump mechanism since one of those fish people swam into one of the intakes outside.
            - The **external flow controls** push the water into the chambers **north and south** only now. The flow controls on the **inside wall switches** the water between **sides east and west**.
            - The trick now is to push the water to the north and south extremes, then switch the water east-west and walk through. The meters by the flow control panels show if there is water in the adjacent room. We've also installed lifeform detection sensors, so there shouldn't be any more aide problems...
            - We're trying to get the system passed as quickly as possible, sir, but the Selkath authorities monitoring our base have made this much more difficult.
