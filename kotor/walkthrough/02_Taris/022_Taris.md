    - This isn't an interrogation. I never said that.
    - Like you said when we first met: Bastila didn't have time to use her powers.
    - I'm a scout. I was recruited into the fleet for my skills, if you must know.
    - **You'd rather I wasn't?**
    - Are you implying *I* had something to do with the crash?
    - Why would Bastila request my transfer?
    - I'm telling you, Carth, I had nothing to do with the crash.
    - Are you always this suspicious?
    - I consider this important.
