## Leaving the planet

    - **Maybe, but we should discuss this only after Malak is stopped.**
- Talk to the researcher
    - I have found data on the genetic structure of your species.
- +1000PX
- Go back to the beach
    - **No time! We have to get off this planet and get to the Star Forge!**
    - **Bastila is dead, Carth. Malak killed her.**
    - She can still be saved, can't she?
    - We can try... and we will.
- Back in the Ebon hawk (with a strange Loading Screen!)
- Go repair the hyperdrive
- Go to the star map -> you can only go to the star forge
