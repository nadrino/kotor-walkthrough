- Meet the Elder Councillor
    - I spoke to you once before? What did I want?
    - I'm sorry. I have no memory of our last meeting.
    - My mind was destroyed, all my memories were lost. It changed me. I am not who I once was.
    - [Persuade] I am a servant of the light now. I want to make amends for the mistakes of the past. (Impossible)
    - [Persuade] The One wanted me to kill you, but I have come here peacefully. (Impossible)
    - [Persuade] I cannot prove what is in my heart. I only ask you judge me by my actions. (EASY)
    - How can I prove that?
    - Maybe I can negotiate with the One to release your hostage.	
    - So if I save the prisoner you'll help me?
    - Okay, I'll help you. But I have some questions.
        - I have questions about you: your tribe, your history, the Temple.
            - Tell me about your tribe.
            - ...
            - I want to learn more about the history of the Rakata Empire.
            - ...
            - What do you know about the other Rakata here?
            - Have you tried reasoning with the One?
            - ...
            - What do you know about the Temple of the Ancients?
            - ...
            - Can you tell me about the Star Forge?
        - ... else
        - // Do you know where I can find parts to repair my ship? -> not available?

        - **I've heard this before.**
        - So what is your research then?
        - You're capturing prisoners... for their genes?
        - Heritage... You mean the Temple?
        - You want to reunite the tribes?
        - How close are you to finishing your research?
        - The One? What's special about him?
        - What kind of information do you need?
