	- We should proceed carefully.
- Go to Star Map
- Get mines
	- What is your purpose?
	- What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?
	- And I don't fit that pattern?
	- That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?
	- Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?
	- I want to ask questions about you and this installation.
	- Who built this installation in the first place?
	- If this place was built 30,000 years ago it predates the Republic.
	- Why was agricultural reformation needed?
	- That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.
	- …
	- Who installed this holo-interface?
	- Who last accessed this installation?
	- Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.
	- But there was an entry at some time?
	- Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?
	- …
	- What's the current function of this installation?
	- Defense of what?
	- 
	- I want to go back to my general questions.
	- What limitations have been placed in your programming?
	- What gaps are missing?
	- 
	- I seek information about a Star Map.
	- Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?
	- What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?
	- How can I match them when I don't know what they are?
	- What do you mean by that?
	- What if I fail?
	- You may begin evaluation.
	- 
	- How did you know Zaalbar's name?
	- Can I confer with someone else?
	- **I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he. -> Wrong but LS**
	- Then I will change my answer.
	- Continue your evaluation then.
	- I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.
		- I evacuate my people from the city. +2PCL -> NO FAIL
	- **I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.**
	- **The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people. + 2 LS**
	- I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.
	- **I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.** + 2PCL

	- I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
	- Let’s get started.
	- What now?

	- **Don't you care about all those lives lost?**
	- But you *have* killed on your own accord before.

	- What about your family?
	- **Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.**
