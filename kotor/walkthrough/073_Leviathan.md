- Left door -> few Sith SOldiers -> kill+loot
- Right -> Sith + Sith Master
- Go toward the red door
- Another bunch of Sith soldiers
- Climb down
- Malak
    - Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...
    - ...
    - I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?
    - **No, I don't believe you, Malak!**
    - Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?
    - **How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?**
    - But why did you betray... your master?
    - Bastila, is this true?
    - Then why don't I remember being Revan?
    - You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!
    - Why not just let me die?
    - But why program me with another identity?
    - Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
    - But what if I remembered who I really was?
    - I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.
    - Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!
- Bastila and Carth are put under statis -> you confront him alone
- At mid-HP -> stops -> contourner les portes
- Again -> kill -> Bastila
- Bastila does like..
- Carth is upset!
    - What about Bastila? We have to help her!	
- Go to the Ebon Hawk
- Sith ships try to hunt down the Ebon Hawk!
- Discussion with others
    - We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.
    - I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.
    - Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all. -> otherwise Carth says youre lying
    - This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!
        - What about you, Jolee?
        - What do you think, Canderous?
        - You won't abandon me, will you T3?
        - What do you have to say, HK-47?
            - Why? What's happening?
            - **Your homing system? What's that?**
            - You mean... Revan?
            - Good. So long as you're loyal.
        - Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
            - I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
            - You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
