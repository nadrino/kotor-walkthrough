- Ebon
  - Disciple with Kreia cutscene
  - **Bao becomes a Jedi**
    - Maybe it's because I stopped wearing that boring Republic uniform.
    - What about me, for giving the order?
    - **If Ulic Qel-Droma could be forgiven for waging war against the Republic, you can be forgiven for saving it.**
    - You did it to save us, to protect us from death.
    - You have dwelled in the past for too long. You cannot undo history, but you can change the future.
    - If you will let me teach you, the Force can become your shield. I believe you could learn to become a Jedi.
    - Then we have no time to waste.
    - `bug, head of Vrook instead of PC -> reload the game`
  - Bao
    - 3 things to learn
  - Visas
    - I wanted to teach you some of the forms I have learned. `Vrook - Shen...`
    - I only taught you to make you stronger, not to serve me.
  - HK
    - [Repair] Install the droid's processor.
  - HK `But until you do, you answer to me.`
    - Any idea what happened to you?
    - Are you okay?
    - Why were you in our storage hold?
    - You look a lot like a series of droids that have attacked me. // -> later -> no necessary
    - You're an assassin droid?
    - What, "meatbag?"
    - Well, get used to it.
    - **I'm not sure I like the idea of having an assassin droid on board.**
    - Are you ready to serve me, droid?
    - +1000 XP
  - Kreia `leveled up after the battle of Khoonda`
    - I want you to teach me more about the Force.
      - I wish to ask about the lesson related to my skills.
      - [Treat Injury] I have devoted myself to healing others.
      - [You have gained a bonus to your weakest and strongest skills, and you have also recovered some of your connection to the Force.] `a_addforcepoints(6);a_global_set("000_Kreia_Skill", 2)`
      - +1000 XP
  - T3-M4 `Computer >= 21`
    - [Computer] I'd like to upgrade your core again.
    - [Computer] This might take a while, so you might want to lock your systems down. `!c_sc_com_lt(21)`
    - All done. How do you feel? `+1 Wisdom +1 Intelligence`
    - [Due to your computer skills, T3 has gained an additional +1 Intelligence and +1 Wisdom.]
    - I... don't know. While I was working on you, I felt strange, detached.
    - +750 XP
- SAVE before selecting NarShaddaa


LATERRR


- Reask `!c_pc_level(20)`!!
  - I want you to teach me more about the Force.
    - Before, when I heard the thoughts of my companions, I heard something, like an echo. `!c_pc_level(20)`
