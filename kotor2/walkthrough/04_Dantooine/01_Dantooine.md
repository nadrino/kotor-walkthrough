- Go out with Bao and T3
- Dillan
  - What are you talking about?
  - Hey, my ship is not banged up!
  - **I'm just visiting. I lived here once.**
  - I haven't been back since I left for the Mandalorian Wars.
  - Where is Khoonda?
  - This is your center of government?
  - I'd be more impressed if there weren't so many holes.
  - Who is Administrator Adare?
  - Why are there so many mercenaries here?
  - Have the mercenaries caused any problems?
  - Who has disappeared?
  - Why do I need permission to enter the Enclave?
  - I'll be going now.
