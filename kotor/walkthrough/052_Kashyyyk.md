- Party change : take Bastila + Mission
	- A nice nest of lies you have constructed.
	- What do you want? Why drag us here?
	- I would not abandon Zaalbar to you.
	- He's standing against you. The first of many, perhaps?
	- Lets go backâ€¦
	- I want to ask about the Shadowlands.
	- I won't do this. Do your own dirty work.
	- I need Zaalbar with me as a guide
	- Who are you talking about, Zaalbar?
	- Play along, Zaalbar. I will see what I can do.
- Level up Bastila (13)
- Longer sur la droite
- Porte **Woorwill**
	- Jarak
		- I wanted to ask you about Kashyyyk.
		- I must leave.
	- Woorwill
		- I understand you. I'm not here as a slaver.
		- Can I ask you some questions?
		- Who was Rorworr?
		- When did Rorworr go missing?
		- Goodbye.
- BANTER !!! Bastila + Mission
- Continuer -> descendre -> porte -> lawyer
- Loot
- Vers sortie
- Bastila propose (6/9)
	- You're curious about something?
	- **Do I have a choice?**
	- **I don't think about it much.**
	- **Are you saying you don't believe in the corruption of the dark side?**
	- What?
```
- 7/9 -> later
	- I'd like to talk about what you said before. About giving in to your emotions.
	- No, I disagree!
	- You're doing your best, I'm sure.
	- You're being too hard on yourself.
	- How did you expect me to be? -> sinon gros lourd
```
- go exit
