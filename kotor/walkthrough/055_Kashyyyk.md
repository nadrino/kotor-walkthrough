- Talk to the hologram (few options are missing in the Switch version?)
    - What is your purpose?
    - What do you mean by behavioral reconfiguration?
    - And I don't fit that pattern?
    - That seems very helpful. Why have I been allowed access?
    - Do you not know why, or are you restricted from saying?
    - I want to ask questions about you and this installation.
    - Who built this installation in the first place?
    - If this place was built 30,000 years ago it predates the Republic.
    - Why was agricultural reformation needed?
    - That is a short period for adaptation of native creatures.
    - …
    - Who installed this holo-interface?
    - Who last accessed this installation?
    - Five years ago is about the time Revan passed this way.
    - But there was an entry at some time?
    - Was there any further contact with the installer of this interface?
    - …
    - What's the current function of this installation?
    - Defense of what?
    - 
    - I want to go back to my general questions.
    - What limitations have been placed in your programming?
    - What gaps are missing?
    - 
    - I seek information about a Star Map.
    - Original system memory? So the map is as old as this installation?
    - What do I need to do to get access to the Star Map?
    - How can I match them when I don't know what they are?
    - What do you mean by that?
    - What if I fail? (not on XBox nether Switch)
    - You may begin evaluation.
    - 
    - How did you know Zaalbar's name?
    - Can I confer with someone else?
    - **I trust Zaalbar. I would say nothing, and neither would he. -> Wrong but LS**
    - Then I will change my answer.
    - Continue your evaluation then.
    - I subtly reinforce the city while preparing to attack.
    - **I prepare my forces to attack in ten days. I do nothing in the city.**
    - **The victory is irrelevant. Stopping the war saved many more people. + 2LSP**
    - I do nothing so I can attack their weak spot later and save more lives.
    - **I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.** + 2PCL
- Full buffer + Echani shield + Krath double sword 
    - easy with powers of droid++ with Jolee
