- Enter Harbinger
    - There's nowhere else to go - the facility is sealed off.
        - Atton's right - we need to get off this ship.
    - We can bypass the force field to the hangar by getting to the engine room on this ship, then exiting through the fuel pipe.
    - Then how did this ship dock here?
    - So let's get their codes, then. Then we can worry about reaching the Ebon Hawk.
    - **Forgive me, Kreia, I was distracted for a moment. I'll be more mindful of the present.** LSP + Inf Kreia
- Download plans 1 repair + logs
- Kill sith toward the savety modules


- Next Harbinger
- Exile room
    - I just need a second - this was my room.
    - Before I lost consciousness and woke up on Peragus.
- Check the corners to spawn sith -> before med bay
- Medical bay
- Repair droid (3 Parts needed)
- Before Sion
    - What's wrong?
    - How do you know that?
    - We'll have to be careful, then. But we have to keep moving.
- UNEQUIP KREIA
- Workbench -> prepare for killing droids now
- Fuel line
    - **Atton, you need to trust me. Come on.** (LSP)
    - ... cutscene with Kreia
    - Kreia... I think she was wounded... badly.
    - I... think it was through the Force.
    - I'm fine. Keep going. [End Dialog]
