- Bastila is being tortured


- Turrets


- Talk with the crew after crashing
    - That disruptor field could wipe out the entire Republic fleet!
    - Hey - I thought we needed to find some stabilizers for the ship!
    - Bastila would never turn to the dark side!
    - **Don't call me that. I'm not Revan anymore.** (+2 LSP)
- Canderous -> can ask now! (END) -> reserve this for later while meeting the mandalorians?
    - What are your thoughts now?
    - Isn't killing enough?
    - What are you going to do?
- Leave the Ebon Hawk with Canderous and Zaalbar (default?)


## Central Beach

- Level up Zaalbar and Canderous (19)
- Move forward a bit -> Rakatan attack
- 2 Duros leave their hidding place
    - Er... No problem!
    - What are you doing here?
    - Where are the rest of your companions?
    - The natives have killed the others?
    - Has anyone found a way off this world?
    - **There are Mandalorians here??**
    - Where are they?
    - Tell me of the natives.
    - You could stay in our ship if you want.
    - Why don't you try to get to one of the other islands?
- Take a few sec to admire the beach :)
- Climb up the hill in front of you (from where the Rakatan came)
- Kill the next round of Rakatan
- Follow the path on the left (to the North beach)
