- Kreia
    - I thought you were dead.
    - A little disoriented... was it your voice I heard in the kolto tank?
    - Enough with the false concern - what do you want?
    - I'm the one asking the questions. How did I get here?
    - If you think I'm a Jedi, you're mistaken.
    - That is no business of yours.
    - All right - what's going on? How did we get here?
    - Care to explain why you're in such a hurry?
    - [Awareness] You seem nervous, worried. Is something wrong? 
    - We'll see. There's got to be someone left alive around here.
    - **[Persuade] The patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?**
    - I wasn't. I got the same dose, but I survived for some reason.
    - You seem to know a lot about Jedi techniques.
    - And maybe when I return you'll actually answer my question.
    - **I'll return soon to make sure you're all right. (PCL)**

- Kreia
    - Kreia? Wh-?

- Atton
  - I'd keep those eyes up, and tell me who you are.
  - Care to explain why you're locked up?
  - What is this place?
  - Blowing yourself up?
  - Peragus II?
  - This facility's deserted. What happened?
  - There's a bounty on captured Jedi? Why?
  - What's the Exchange?
  - Why would they offer a bounty on Jedi?
  - Did the Exchange wipe them all out?
  - I had heard rumors of a war - but a war between Jedi?
  - I've been... away since the Mandalorian Wars.
  - I was led to believe that Revan saved the Jedi - and the Republic.
  - How long have you been in that cage? Revan was a man, not a woman.
  - I had some more questions for you.
  - Don't you know what happened to them?
  - [Persuade] Tell me your plan, and we can go from there.
  - [Persuade] One thing first... the patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?
  - Wanted to know if you knew anything - and you don't.
  - I trust you. And if we work together, we may be able to get out of this mess.
  - ...
  - Sounds like you're about to tell me something I don't want to hear.
  - [Repair] That wouldn't be standard procedure in an emergency lockdown.
  - There must be some way to end the lockdown from here.
  - Can we contact the miners?
  - Let's see if we can try and reach someone on the comm.


In Peragus mines
- Sneak by every droid
- Raise temperature of tunels
- Kill every droid from the trigger to the begining
- Get all mines -> 6 parts at the begining
- Repair droid
- Trigger -> kill all -> leave


- HK50
  - How do you know me? I'm not your Master.
  - Who was your previous Master?
  - What happened?
  - Why don't you tell me anyway?
  - How come I don't remember any of this?
  - Incapacitated?
  - Drugged?! What do you mean drugged?
  - So I wasn't sealed in the cargo hold - someone locked me in.
  - Fine - what happened next?
  - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
  - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
  - Bounty?
  - But why would that ship have taken me off the Harbinger?
  - How so?
  - **Why would someone want me captured?**
  - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
  - That information wouldn't have been in coreward databases... only in Jedi archives.
  - Potential hostiles?
  - I see... go on.
  - Then what happened?
  - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
  - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
    - Are there any left alive?
    - **Then I need to get in there to rescue them. (LSP)**
    - Can we try to contact them using a comlink?
    - Satisfaction?
    - We don't know what happened to them, so we need to find out.
    - **Those miners could be hurt or in danger - we need to make sure they're all right. (LSP)**
    - I'm your Master, and I'm giving you an order to assist me.
    - This just keeps getting better and better. Who's got the damn code?
    - If you have the code, then give it to me.
    - Voiceprinted?
    - But you do know the code.
    - Leave "condescending" out of your speech conditionals from now on, or else.
    - Fine. Now tell me how to get off this rock.
    - I had some other questions for you.


- HIM
  - What are you?
  - Veiled threats?
  - What's a translation droid doing on Peragus?
  - What have you determined?
  - I never said you were coming with me.



- T3?
  - Have you seen a T3 unit?
  - The unit was last seen near the hangar.
  - Then maybe you can answer something else for me.


- Cadaver
  - What's that body there?
  - Screams?
  - Wait - if you can play back his voice, can't you speak the voice code?
  - Believed to possess?
  - [Persuade] The fact you can mimic voices is pretty impressive. What would it sound like if you did speak the code to the console?
  - Can you follow me and say that again?
  - Looks like I'll need to find some way to carry your voice there - or record it.
  - No, I had some other questions I wanted to ask you.




- Kill all and back to admin level
- Talk to Atton
  - I found a... talkative... protocol droid down in the fuel depot.
  - No, I thought about it, though.
  - And you can?
  - I need to open an airlock, but it's sealed with a voiceprint protocol by the maintenance officer.
  - It looks that way.
  - I have a sonic sensor and the code - I just need to find the right words to record.
  - The miners may still be alive, they're trapped in the dormitory section.
  - None that I know of.
  - **I'm not leaving them trapped and helpless on this facility. (LSP)**
  - I'll return if I find anything.

- Kreia
  - Just checking to make sure you're all right.
  - As "helpful" as your cryptic warnings are, why don't you find some way to make yourself useful?
  - I keep hearing your voice as I explore this place.
  - Unforeseen consequences?
  - What if it doesn't pass?
  - I don't care... just stay out of my head, got it?
  - All right, then - I'll be back.

- See console med bay -> ID
- Back to the fuel area
- Admin console 
  - Check ID
  - Logs -> sensor
  - other things
  - cameras -> T3!!
- Back to HK
  - I found a T3 unit in one of the fuel pipes. It looks damaged.
    - I had some more questions for you.
  - REVIEW THIS PART - HK 50
    - How do I know you again?
    - Tell me everything that happened between the Harbinger and now.
    - For a droid, you don't take orders too well. Now tell me what happened.
    - And where was I when this was taking place?
    - There - you said "locked" again.
    - Maybe you better explain the "stupor" part.
    - ... took another route... 
    - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
    - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
    - And the Ebon Hawk came here?
    - What happened once the ship arrived?
    - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
    - "Unpleasantness?" What are you talking about?
    - Then what happened?
    - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
    - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
      - Are you responsible for all this? (interesting for the plot...)
      - I think you are responsible.
      - Do you know who administered sedatives to the kolto tanks in the medical bay, killing the incapacitated miners?
      - Is that pride I hear in your voice?
      - I had some more questions for you.
  - Make him repeat the last words of the officer


- Open the door with the console -> level up to 5?


- Outside
- Atton
  - I'm right outside the observation window.
  - I need to reach the miners in the dormitory section, and this is the only way to get there.
  - I'm trying to pick up the pace, believe me.
  - Why are the vents placed so close to the exterior scaffolding?
  -
