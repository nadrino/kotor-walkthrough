    - A little disoriented... was it your voice I heard in the kolto tank?
    - Enough with the false concern - what do you want?
    - I'm the one asking the questions. How did I get here?
    - If you think I'm a Jedi, you're mistaken.
    - That is no business of yours.
    - All right - what's going on? How did we get here?
    - Care to explain why you're in such a hurry?
    - [Awareness] You seem nervous, worried. Is something wrong? 
    - We'll see. There's got to be someone left alive around here.
    - **[Persuade] The patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?**
    - I wasn't. I got the same dose, but I survived for some reason.
    - You seem to know a lot about Jedi techniques.
    - And maybe when I return you'll actually answer my question.
    - **I'll return soon to make sure you're all right. (PCL)**
