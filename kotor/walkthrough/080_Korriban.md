    - This is a prison?
    - What did you do to get imprisoned here?
    - You said "three in a row" earlier. Have there been others besides me?
    - Is there no way out of here?
    - Out? Out to where? If you get out of here, your body's probably dead.
    - Look... you are *not* getting my body.
    - Forget it! Tell me how to get out! NOW!!
    - This sounds deceptively simple.
    - How do I know I could trust you?
    - It only takes once.
    - What kind of competition do you mean?
    - I'd rather a more physical challenge.
    - And what's to stop you from cheating?
    - I don't seem to have much of a choice.

      If you touch me, I may be snared.
      If you lose me, nothing will matter."
    - **Tomorrow**.
    - "What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than the trees,
      up up it goes and yet it never grows."
    - **A grave.**
    - "You heard me before, yet you hear me again,
      Then I die, until you call me again."
    - **A flame.**
    - "You can see nothing else when you look in my face,
      I will look you in the eye and I will never lie."
    - Before I go, what's your name?
    - I could try to find some other way to get you out of here.
    - I could destroy your prison once I'm out... if you wish.
    - Don't worry. I'm sure someone else will be along before you know it.
