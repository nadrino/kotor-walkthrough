- Go back to Chodo
  - The Exchange will trouble you no longer.
  - I cannot accept this from you, Chodo. Consider it my investment in Telos. (+1LSP)
  - How did Czerka imbed itself in the first place?
  - All right. I'll help you.
  - [Computer] So it can't be sliced?
  - How do you propose we obtain those files?
  - Have you tried bribing a Czerka employee?
  - [Persuade] I am not sure, but we should try. (+500c) -> other? -> NO? need 1000 later -> comeback -> maybe ok
  - I will see what I can do.
- Go to Cantina
- Corun Falt
  - What can you tell me about Czerka?
  - Tell me about Lorso.
  - How do you think she'll mess up?
  - Maybe I can help you.
  - There are some files I'd like to get my hands on. Files I imagine wouldn't make her look good if they went public.
  - Something like that, yes.
  - A closed system?
  - So how do I get in?
  - No, I'm serious. How do I get in?
  - So it's a gamble. How much to cover your risk?
  - I'll be back with it. [End Dialog]
- Come back to Chodo
  - I need 1,000 credits to bribe a corrupt Czerka executive. (or 500c if already asked?)
  - Thanks. I'll return later. [End Dialog]
- Corun Falt (need awareness > 10 and persuade > 6)
  - [Awareness] You're reaching. 300 would be enough.
  - You mean, B-4D4 could walk right in.
  - Is that all? What a great help you are.
  - All right. I'll be going now. [End Dialog]
- Go to Opo Chano
  - I want your droid technician credentials.
  - I need to borrow Czerka's administrative droid.
  - Because I need him to get some files from Czerka's mainframe to expose Czerka's corruption to the Telosian authorities.
  - You can't? Why not?
  - Your contract? Why is that?
  - Credits? What for?
  - A loan? From whom?
  - Hey, I answered all of your questions.
  - Slusk and Luxa are dead and the Exchange is in disarray. They won't enforce your debt.
  - Just say your credentials were stolen.
  - Try it. It's easy.
  - That's not true. You're lying.
  - What if I repaid your loan?
  - I'll be back when I have the credits. [End Dialog]
- Chodo!
  - I need 2,500 credits to loan to a Czerka droid technician.
  - Thanks. I'll return later. [End Dialog]
- Back to Opo Chano
  - Yes, here: 2500 credits.
  - Keep the money in return for the credentials.
- Go to Czerka office
- reask
  - I need you to come with me.
  - I have my droid technician credentials right here.
  - Let's go now. [End Dialog]
- TP to Ithorians office
  - Please reiterate the mission.
  - [Lie] I do not understand.
  - I was merely testing my ability to lie.
  - I will return when I have obtained the files. [End Dialog]
