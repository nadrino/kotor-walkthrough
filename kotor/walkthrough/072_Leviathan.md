    - **No, I don't believe you, Malak!**
    - Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?
    - **How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?**
    - But why did you betray... your master?
    - Bastila, is this true?
    - Then why don't I remember being Revan?
    - You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!
    - Why not just let me die?
    - But why program me with another identity?
    - Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
    - But what if I remembered who I really was?
    - I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.

    - We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.
    - I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.
    - Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all. -> otherwise Carth says youre lying
    - This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!

            - You mean... Revan?
            - Good. So long as you're loyal.
        - Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
            - I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
            - You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
