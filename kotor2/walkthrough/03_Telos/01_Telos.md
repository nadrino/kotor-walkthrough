- Arrest
    - Are we under arrest?
    - **This is outrageous. You don't have any evidence.**
    - Will I be able to get my gear back?
    - No. Why are you holding us?
    - The TSF can't hold me for anything. We're leaving right now. Do you understand?
    - I'll go... but one way or another, you'll pay me for the trouble.
- You are in prison
    - A force cage? This is ridiculous.
    - Wait - I had some questions.
- Batu Rem
    - You're wrong. I'm no Jedi.
    - We're in a TSF station. How do you expect to get away with this?
    - I don't wish to fight you.
- Grenn comes
    - Impressive. You allowed an assassin to infiltrate your ranks.
    - How did he manage to sneak in here?
    - Great. That's reassuring.
    - The best of your ability? That's not very inspiring.
    - Just take me to my quarters.


- Tp to your appartment
    - How long will I be here?
    - Why do we need to leave?
    - What do you think, Kreia?
    - (Rest.)
- Call
    - Accept call.
    - What does he want?
    - Fine, send him in.
    - Why didn't he come himself?
    - What does Chodo want with me?
    - No, could you explain it to me?
    - No, what troubles have you had?
    - How is Czerka harming the restoration project?
    - Why would Czerka do this?
    - How did they take the Restoration Zones?
    - Could you get to the point?
    - What do you mean?
    - I'll speak with your leader when I'm freed.
- Call
    - Accept call.
    - What does she want?
    - Why are you calling?
    - "Imposed guilt?"
    - What sort of rumors?
    - I don't recall him threatening me.
    - No, he didn't mention anything like that.
    - Go on.
    - How are the Ithorians in the way of things?
    - What sort of work are we talking about?
    - I'll come by when I can.
    - (Rest.)
- Kreia & Atton talks...
- Green comes back (203tel/203atton.dlg)
    - Why is the Republic sending a ship?
    - How long will I have to stay?
    - Is the Ebon Hawk still impounded?
    - What about my T3 droid?
    - You know that from experience?
    - Why would Telos be doomed?
    - What do you think, Kreia?
    - Why don't we ask the Republic for help against the Sith?
- Talk to Atton
    - What do you mean?
    - I'm fine. In fact, I haven't felt this good in a long time.
    - Nothing, never mind. [End Dialog]
- You're free!
