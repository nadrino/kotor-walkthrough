- Exchange guard
- Czerka office
- B-4D4
  - Is this blaster of Czerka make?
  - Why would a Czerka weapon be in the hands of an assassin?
  - I'll be going now.
- Kreia intercept you (203kreia.dlg)
  - **I don't need your approval, Kreia.**
  - **I don't sense he intends to do us harm.**
  - Perhaps you are right, Kreia. But we need his help, at least for the time being.
- Go to your apartment
- Remove Atton from the group (DSP propagate to party members)
- Go to Sleep
- Talk to Kreia (light side)
    - There is enough suffering in the galaxy - if I can alleviate for one person, then I have made a difference.
    - I fail to see how small acts of mercy can be harmful. (-> don't be to hard on Kreia?)
    - **Then I shall view you as disposable, then.** `a_influence_inc(6, 1)&&a_givedark(1)` -> influence is very important!
    - Never mind. I'll be going now.
- Transit back to the Entertainment module
