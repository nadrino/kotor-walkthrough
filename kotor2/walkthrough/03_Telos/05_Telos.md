- Go to your appartment
- Equip back your stuff
- Go to Czerka -> Batono
- Jana Lorso -> she talks with the two assasins we are looking for! (-> without TSLRCM -> first conv) (rodkill.dlg)
  - Wait! You're the criminals the TSF is hunting for.
- Does the name Batono mean anything to you? (BUG -> can't ask that anymore now)
  - He's gone missing, do you have any idea where he might have gone?
  - Grenn and the TSF are looking for him. He asked me to find him.
  - A reward?
  - How much?
  - How would you put an end to his investigation?
  - How would you convince him to abandon his investigation, then?
  - I will tell you if I find him.
- Leave the office


- Ithorians?
- Chodo
  - The ship I arrived in was recently stolen. Do you know anything about it?
  - Why don't you help me find my ship first?
- Reask
  - Do you know anything about a man named Batono?
  - I thought you might know of him, given his dislike of Czerka.
  - Are you sure? Lorso mentioned that he spent time here in the compound.
  - [Persuade] I'm looking for him on behalf of Lieutenant Grenn. If I can locate him, it might prove the end of Czerka.
  - I give you my word, Chodo.
  - I'll be going now. [End Dialog]
- Go see the diplomat -> LATER -> can't open the conainer
  - Who are you?
  - Why are you here?
