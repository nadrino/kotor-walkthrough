## Back to Ebon

- Juhani (after second star map talk)
    - What are you thinking about?
    - **And how are things different now?**
    - We are all in this together.
- HK (14 repair) -> LATER!!
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let’s get started.
    - What now?
    - That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?
    - **Don't you care about all those lives lost?**
    - //? But you *have* killed on your own accord before.
    - So another master gone because of you.
    - No doubt.
    - You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?
    - You would have been found out eventually.
    - I should dismantle you!
    - How very self-sacrificing of you.
    - Do you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.]
- Star Map -> Dantooine


## Back to Dantooine

- Go out alone
- Buy -> LATER
	- Calrissian's Utility Belt ? -> On Xbox need a patch to deploy bezfore arriving there!
- Stowaway
	- There is a stowaway on my ship by the name of Sasha.
	- Yes, I am. She only speaks a smattering of Mandalorian, but I was able to figure it out.
	- Certainly. I'll bring you to my ship.
	- Lur Arka na bads. Nuh-gisen laesfa, Sasha.
- Equip the belt -> HK (17 repair) -> Later
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let's get started.
    - What? Why not?
    - Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
    - You are eager to find your origins, are you?
    - Well…
    - So tell me about this last owner, then.
    - **It appears no one could resist using your protocol.**
    - I suppose I would, at that.
    - Oh? Why is that?
    - So you killed *that* master directly.
    - You are just a travelling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
    - You don't want to hear the answer to that.
    - So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
    - So can you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.]
- Go to star map -> Kashyyk
