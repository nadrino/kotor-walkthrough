- Czerka office
- Kreia intercept you (203kreia.dlg)
  - I don't need your approval, Kreia.

  - Perhaps you are right, Kreia. But we need his help, at least for the time being.
- Go to your appartment
- B-4D4
  - Is this blaster of Czerka make?
  - Why would a Czerka weapon be in the hands of an assassin?
  - I'll be going now. [End Dialog]
- Remove Atton from the group (DSP propagate to party members)
- Go to Sleep
- Talk to Kreia (light side)

    - I fail to see how small acts of mercy can be harmful. (-> don't be to hard on Kreia?)
    - Then I shall view you as disposable, then. (+1DSP!! but +1 infl on Kreia -> more important)
    - Never mind. I'll be going now. [End Dialog]
