Crash landing

- Meet Bao-Dur
  - My head... feels like I've been ripped in half.
  - General?
  - **I think I might recall you.**
  - How are the others?
  - Looking for my ship.
  - **What shot us down?**
  - Why would a research station have an air defense tower?
  - Let's go. We need to find our ship.
  - **Why not?**
  - What's a cannok?
  - I don't see any herbivores around.
  - Let's get going.
- Give Atton's armor to Bao-Dur
- Kill the canokks first on the left
- Get the mines behind the ship -> Mercenary cache
- Kill the mecernaries
- Next droid centry
- The two mercenaries
  - I was just thinking the same thing.
  - It's a long story, Bao-Dur.
- Put everybody in stationary -> mines!
- Walk on the beach
- Bao-Dur and Kreia discuss
  - A whisper, perhaps. Like the breeze through the grass.
  - Let's go along the shore.
- Attack the merc behind the rock
- Use shield breaker on the merc at the center with Bao
- Loot the cache
- Mine & turrets SAVE
- Use bao for stealth NOOO bad at stealth... and demolition
  - Only main PC
