## The South Part of the Upper City

![](../resources/images/maps/02_Taris/map_taris_upper_streets1.png)

#### (1) Leaving your building

> Take-off your weapons (let's be RP!)

#### (2) Talk to the passers-by randomly

- Talk to some people
  
> In general people are very anxious about the Sith occupation. And with good reasons!
> The quarantine and the military occupation usually means colonisation, and people know
> the republic won't protect them anyway...

- Talk to a Sith

> The conversation won't be long as you would expect. Fun fact: the Sith soldiers are
> actually nicer than some irl cops lol. ;)

- Talk to a touristic Droid
    - What can you tell me about the Sith?
    - Is there some way I can get a shuttle off this planet?
    - Do you know anything about the gangs in the Lower City?
    - How come there are hardly any aliens around?
    - Who do you work for?
    - I don't need anything right now.

> Clearly these droids have been reprogrammed by the new authority. This conversation
> gives you the official spoken version of the occupation.

#### (3) Note some crashed escape pods are still being taken away

> Here you can understand that you were unconscious for a quite short period of time.
> The Sith invasion must have started only few hours ago. 
> 
> Extrapolation: this capsule might be the one that brought you here... Carth may have
> found the apartment while carying you on his shoulders. By looking at the crash landing
> cinematic, it seems like you arrived early the morning (like 5 a.m.). Since you gonna
> see the stores are already opened, we can estimate it is currently around 8. 

#### (4) Head in directon of the Cantina

> Here the game shows that you can learn more about your teammates. This dialog introduces
> a long series of conversation you can have with Carth. In his case, there is 12 steps
> that will unlock along the storyline.
> 
> Note that the game won't always remind you that you should talk to them. We will then
> initiate those dialog lines regularly during this walkthrough.

- **Proposition to talk with Carth (0/12)**
    - I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.
    - You're talking like it's your fault. Like you failed somehow.
    - Them? Do you mean the people of your home world?

#### (4) The Equipment Emporium

- Meet Kebla Yurt, the vendor
    - I want to ask you some questions.
    - I was wondering how you feel about the Sith?
    - I need some general information on Taris.
    - Swoop gangs? What can you tell me about them?
    - What do you know about Davik?
    - Is Davik working with the Sith?
    - Do you know anything about those escape pods that crashed here on Taris?
    - I'll be going now.
  
> We will discover her inventory later. She has rather good weapons, but we don't
> have a lot of money now.


#### (5) Enter the Cantina

> A Sith guard is holding the door. He will let you enter without any hesitation :).
