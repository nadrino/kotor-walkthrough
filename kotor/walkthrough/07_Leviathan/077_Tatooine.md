## A last time on Tatooine

- Mission + Carth (level up Mission 16 to 17)
    - Equip Missin with Darth Bandon Armor? -> GenoHara armor will be the best for Mission
- Czerka office
    - Go in direction of the Rodian (shop)
        - What kind of mistake?
        - Did he say where he was going?
        - Good riddance!
    - Talk to Mission
        - Brother
        - **Don't give up on him, Mission. He could still change.** (+2LSP)
        - So you're okay?
- END OF MISSION'S STORY!
- Replace Mission with Canderous (equip Darth Bandon Armor)
- Go toward the gate
    - Banther -> not on switch
        - Carth isn't like you, Canderous.
- Leave Anchorhead to the dune sea
- 7 people are waiting for you!!!
    - I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone.
    - Three Genoharadan Overseers out of four are dead, Hulas. Time to finish the job!
- Loot every corpse -> good stuff!
- Transit back
    - Canderous
        - Tell me about when you worked for Davik. (not tried...)
        - **You were an assassin?**
        - **A wise decision.**
        - **Regret in a Mandalorian is unbecoming.**
- Go to Korriban!
