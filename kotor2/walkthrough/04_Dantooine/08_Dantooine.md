- // Kreia -> LATER!!
- Reask `-> could be done later`
    - I want you to teach me more about the Force.
      - Before, when you taught me to listen - I wish to continue that lesson.
        - :: That sound in the background - what is it? ::
        - :: I hear you. This... this is incredible. :: `a_addforcepoints(6);a_krepcup()`
        - What about T3?
        - But I did hear something from Bao-Dur.
        - Maybe it is because I know him better; I served with him.
        - **There was also something wrong with Atton's thoughts.**
        - Perhaps. Maybe I will go see him - and see how his pazaak game is coming.
  - Atton
    - Atton, why do you play pazaak in your head?
      - [Repair] There are no ticks in the power coupling - it's fixed. `c_sc_rep_gt(3)`
      - You're not making any sense.
      - I don't want to play pazaak.
      - This better not be using Nar Shaddaa rules.
      - If it's a friendly game, sure.
      - ...
      - I was trying to compute the totals to twenty.
      - **Atton, before, I felt your mind. With Kreia's help. I'm sorry.** `a_influence_inc(1);a_global_set("000_Atton_Pazaak", 90)`
      - What do you have to hide?
      - Is that something you can train me to do?
      - No - I want to learn to shield my mind.
      - Then I want to learn to play pazaak.
      - [Atton has taught you to play pazaak in your head as a way of resisting mental domination. You have gained a permanent +1 to your Willpower saves.]
- I want you to teach me more about the Force.
  - You taught me of sight - is there anything else you can teach me?
  - What do you mean?
  - [Repair]
  - [Treat Injury]
  - Very well. I shall take this lesson to heart. `a_influence_inc(6, 1)`
  - I'll think on this, and return when my weakest skill is stronger.
- Reask `!c_pc_level(20)`!!
  - I want you to teach me more about the Force.
    - Before, when I heard the thoughts of my companions, I heard something, like an echo. `!c_pc_level(20)`
    - 


- Ebon?
  - Bao
    - I wanted to teach you some of the techniques I've learned in my travels. `a_bao_teach(176)`
  - Kreia
    - Skill
    - Very well. I shall take this lesson to heart.
- Old man -> with Kreia and Atton?
  

LATERRR

- **Bao becomes a Jedi** >> LATER
  - Maybe it's because I stopped wearing that boring Republic uniform.
  - What about me, for giving the order?
  - **If Ulic Qel-Droma could be forgiven for waging war against the Republic, you can be forgiven for saving it.**
  - You did it to save us, to protect us from death.
  - You have dwelled in the past for too long. You cannot undo history, but you can change the future.
  - If you will let me teach you, the Force can become your shield. I believe you could learn to become a Jedi.
  - Then we have no time to waste.
