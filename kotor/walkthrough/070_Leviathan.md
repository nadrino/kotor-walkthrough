## Headquarters

- Talk
	- //This is your chance to avenge the deaths of your family!  -> DS walkthrough
	- Don't let your lust for revenge cloud your judgment, Carth.
	- **Bastila, is there some way you could use your Battle Meditation here?**
	    - You can send:
	    - Mission
	    - T3
	    - Jolee
	    - Canderous
	    - Juhani
	    - HK
	- T3-M4 is a pretty resourceful little guy. He could pull this off.
	- Let's do it.

## Interview with Saul

- You get captured
	- You're wasting your time, Saul. I'll never betray the Jedi!
	- **History? What are you talking about?**
	- What are you talking about?
	- **Don't hurt her, I beg you.**
	- **[Persuade/Lie] Alderaan. It's on Alderaan.** LOL
	- No, you're lying! It isn't true!
	- [Persuade/Lie] We have been sent to assassinate Lord Malak.
	- This accomplishes nothing, Saul. We will never betray the Republic.
- â€¦
	- No one is without hope of redemption, Bastila.
	- Maybe Admiral Karath was lying.
	- Where is Saul Karath now?
	- **I'm sorry, Bastila. Watching you suffer tore me apart.**


## T3-M4 to the Rescue

- T3-M4 is being hacked
    - [You sense the other droid attempting to access your higher memory areas. You will need to take key opportunities to interfere with the process and slice the enemy droid in turn.]

    - 3 (Fibonacci numbers in reverse order)
    - [A new series of numbers are inbound. By completing the series you can corrupt the data stream and disrupt the other droid's programming.]
    - 10 (only remaining two-digit binary combination)
    - [Disrupting one more data stream by completing the series should wipe out all communication processing systems and force the enemy droid into permanent shutdown.]
    - 11 (next prime number)

    - Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?
    - **How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?**
    - But why did you betray... your master?
    - Bastila, is this true?
    - Then why don't I remember being Revan?
    - You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!
    - Why not just let me die?
    - But why program me with another identity?
    - Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
    - But what if I remembered who I really was?
    - I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.

            - You mean... Revan?
            - Good. So long as you're loyal.
        - Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
            - I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
            - You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
