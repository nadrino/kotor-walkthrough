- Galon Lor
    - Who are you?
    - Why not? Aren't there records?
    - What are you doing here?
    - Who is Ajunta Pall?
    - His sword?
    - Hasn't any effort been made to recover it?
    - What makes the tombs so dangerous?
    - Why don't you go in, then?
    - Are you a coward, then?
    - What do you know about the sword's powers?
    - I've got to be going.
- Door -> Mine
- Locked door -> T3
- Beasts kill
- Loot Sith corpse -> datapad
- Next room -> loot on the right
- Droid platform -> can't open
- Arm with datapad on the floor -> suggests to explode the structures
- Put grenade in obelisk
- Droids wakeup
    - Kill will force powers
- _Leveler_ is useless (kill the droids but no xp is given)
- Open the locked door next
- Mine! (SAVE)
- Open the tomb -> loot -> 3 swords? -> Ajunta Pall appears -> Juhani talks
    - **[Persuade] I was here once before, I think. Do you remember me?** (after Leviathan)
    - Are you... Ajunta Pall?
    - You were a Sith Lord? From the ancient times?
    - What do you mean by 'those we had betrayed'?
    - What can you tell me about this place?
    - What do you mean? Came from where?
    - **[Persuade] Tell me the secret.** (NEVER WORKS)
    - Why? What is at this place?
    - How did you fall? What happened?
    - The Sith fled, yes. And they returned.
    - This secret... is it the Star Map?
    - I need this sword you speak of.
    - What do you want me to do with it? // CHALLENGE!
    - And if the sword isn't yours?
    - How will I know which sword it is?
- You need to choose the right sword -> look at the description
- It is the Notched Steel Sword
- Loot one corpse
- Statue
    - [The notched steel sword.]
- Go back to him (SAVE)
    - There's no need to remain here, is there?
    - You can return to the light side and end your torment.
    - [Persuade] I don't believe the light side would turn you away. You have suffered long enough. (HARD or Medium)
- +6LSP + 1000PX + SWORD -> best for later
- Go back
- Shaardan is waiting for you
    - Shaardan? What do you want?
    - [Persuade/Lie] I don't know what you're talking about. What sword? (IMPOSSIBLE)
    - And if I don't?
    - What are you going to give me for it?
    - You'll take it over my dead body.
- Kill him + loot
- Leave
- Galon Lor
  - I got it from Ajunta himself, if you must know.
  - No, not exactly.
- He leaves the place
- Next tomb: Marko Ragnos (on the other side)
- Loot on the way
