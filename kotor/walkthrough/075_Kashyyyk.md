- Leave the Ebon Hawk -> take Zaalbar and Jolee -> level up (16 to 17)
- Equip Jedi Master Robe to Jolee


- To the shadow lands -> at the south of Jolee's house
- right -> A wookie is dead (he has a datapad...)
- Another wookie is standing near a camp fire...
    - I want to ask you some questions.
    - ... reask
    - According to a datapad I found, Grarwwaar is dead!
    - Your tricks don't fool me, Rulan!
- Try to kill him -> he will transform to monster -> ten Tach -> run away
- Try to find him
- He is at the small cul de sac near Jolee house -> kill 3 monsters -> Tach -> kill -> ok
- Go back to Ebon Hawk
