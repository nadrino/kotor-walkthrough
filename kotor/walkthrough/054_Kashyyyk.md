# Back Ebon

- Improve LS for Jolee + Mission+Carth weapon + Short LS **Take short LS in left hand -> RED !**
- Canderous (Xbox ok but leviathan first ?) 5/6
    - Tell me more about the Mandalorian Wars.
    - But what about the Sith?
    - But you eventually lost.
    - Why didn't you retreat?
- HK (3/4) (14 repair -> should be native now)
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Letâ€™s get started.
    - What now?
    - That makes sense. Did the Hutts build you?
    - **Don't you care about all those lives lost?**
    - But you \*have\* killed on your own accord before.
    - So another master gone because of you.
    - No doubt.
    - You would have preferred to stay on Sleheyron?
    - You would have been found out eventually.
    - I should dismantle you!
    - How very self-sacrificing of you.
    - Do you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 6 seconds, in addition to his other abilities.]
- Jolee -> ask for medkit
- Juhani (4/6) (Level 15)
    - I was wondering if we could talk.
    - Tell me more about your past.
    - **There were no Cathar on Taris that I saw.**
    - Why did they flee? (What cause them to flee?)
    - Near the world your species comes from?
    - How did it happen?
    - Why did the Republic not help you?
    - What about your family?
    - **Taris is not a nice place to raise a child.**
    - How did he die?
- reask now Juhani -> ask about Canderous ! **Very rare option!** -> disappearing option lol
    - _if you made Juhani interact with Canderous like told in this guide, you should have it._
    - _Don't do the 5/6 discussion before, otherwise this line will be deleted_
        - I was wondering if we could talk.
        - **Why are you so hostile towards Canderous?**
        - He has proven himself well.
        - You should not judge Canderous by other Mandalorians.
            - **Perhaps we will have to eliminate him, then.** -> makes no sence
        - **Have you spoken to him?**
        - **A wise decision. We do not need internal conflict.**
        - **Just?**
        - **I think you will come to trust him in time.**
        - **About what?**
- Ask Bastila if no proposition in the village
  - I'd like to talk about what you said before. About giving in to your emotions.
  - No, I disagree!
  - You're doing your best, I'm sure.
  - You're being too hard on yourself.
  - How did you expect me to be? -> sinon gros lourd


- Go out with Jolee and Carth -> for banter + Dustin
- Ask Merchant
    - I found this droid head. Can I ask you about it?
    - It recorded an ambush. Someone yells Eli's name.
    - **Don't act rashly, Matton. Eli is through. Violence won't help.** +6PCL + 638XP
- Carth levels up (14) -> already
- Reask the new Vendor !
    - He won't last long hiding in the Shadowlands. (Carth comments)
    - His reputation's shot. Someone honest could take over.
        - //I suppose that closes his little outpost here.
    - In that case, let's see what's for sale.
- 500c

![KOTOR Guide-7](../resources/images/screenshots/KOTOR%20Guide-7.png)

    - You're a friend of Carth, I take it?
    - I understand. We'll go as soon as possible.
- Switch Carth with Canderous (level up 13)
- Go to forest by foot (no mob along the way)
