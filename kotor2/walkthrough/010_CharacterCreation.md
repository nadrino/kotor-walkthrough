## Assumptions

This guide is (originally) intended to make a "canon" playthrough of Star Wars - Knights
of the Old Republic II. It means that main character you play is a female which will make
light-side (LS) actions to complete the story.

In the future dark-side (DS) choices as well as a male character options will be added to
this guide in parallel of the original configuration.

## Character Creation

- Let's start a new game!

> Contrary to K1, you start the game by directly selecting a "Jedi" class.
> Indeed, the character you are about to play is former Jedi who got retired
> after the war, and thus is referred as "the Exile" by the other characters.
> So technically the Exile is still a Jedi, but she(-he) has radically stopped
> using it.
> 
> While you will progress through the story, your character will slowly learn
> again to use the force.

- Create a **Female Jedi Sentinel**
