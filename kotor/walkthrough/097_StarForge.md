## Finding Malak

- Take the door on the right
- Giant room
- Meet Malak on the next door 
    - It's you who can't escape, Malak. Surrender and the Jedi might show you mercy.
    - I was saved from the darkness, Malak. You can be too, if you wish. (+2LSP otherwise +6DSP!!!)
- You could ignore the droid an run toward Malak but not RP...
- A lot (infinite) of droid will try to kill you
- Run to a computer (directly after the pillar on the left) to create a droid friend
- Then go to the other computers to disable the generator
    - Creating a friend disable tje generator too
- In the end Malak door will open and the droid will become friendly
- Take the elevator

## Defeating Malak

- Malak
    - The light side is stronger than you know, Malak.
    - I will never serve the dark side again, Malak!
    - I believe in the power of redemption.
- The battle starts!!!
- It's the moment to use all your stimulants!
- Start to try and kill him -> hard -> use Shock++ if needed
- Malak
    - Is there some point to this?
- Kill all the healers (with shock++ -> if not enough force power -> kill him)
- Finish him (use all stimulants + speed++)
    - This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.
    - I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.
- You leave
    - Darth Malak is dead. It's over, finally.
- Ending cinematic
