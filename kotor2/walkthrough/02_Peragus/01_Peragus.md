  - I thought you were dead.
  - A little disoriented... was it your voice I heard in the kolto tank?
  - Just stay out of my mind in the future. Now what do you want?
  - I'm the one asking the questions. How did I get here?
  - If you think I'm a Jedi, you're mistaken.
  - That is no business of yours.
  - All right - what's going on? How did we get here?
  - Care to explain why you're in such a hurry?
  - [Awareness] You seem nervous, worried. Is something wrong?
  - We'll see. There's got to be someone left alive around here.
  - **[Persuade] The patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?**
  - They didn't. I got the same dose, but survived.
  - You seem to know a lot about Jedi techniques.
  - And maybe when I return you'll actually answer my question.
  - **I'll return soon to make sure you're all right. (PCL)**

  - **I trust you. And if we work together, we may be able to get out of this mess.** (a_givelight)
  - Alright let's go.
  - ...
  - Sounds like you're about to tell me something I don't want to hear.
  - [Repair] That wouldn't be standard procedure in an emergency lockdown.
  - There must be some way to end the lockdown from here.
