## Dialogs

- Kreia (to REVIEW)
    - I thought you were dead.
    - A little disoriented... was it your voice I heard in the kolto tank?
    - Enough with the false concern - what do you want?
    - I'm the one asking the questions. How did I get here?
    - If you think I'm a Jedi, you're mistaken.
    - That is no business of yours.
    - All right - what's going on? How did we get here?
    - Care to explain why you're in such a hurry?
    - [Awareness] You seem nervous, worried. Is something wrong? 
    - We'll see. There's got to be someone left alive around here.
    - **[Persuade] The patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?**
    - I wasn't. I got the same dose, but I survived for some reason.
    - You seem to know a lot about Jedi techniques.
    - And maybe when I return you'll actually answer my question.
    - **I'll return soon to make sure you're all right. (PCL)**

  - What's the Exchange?
  - Why would they offer a bounty on Jedi?
  - Did the Exchange wipe them all out?
  - I had heard rumors of a war - but a war between Jedi?
  - I've been... away since the Mandalorian Wars.
  - I was led to believe that Revan saved the Jedi - and the Republic.
  - How long have you been in that cage? Revan was a man, not a woman.
  - I had some more questions for you.
  - Don't you know what happened to them?
  - [Persuade] Tell me your plan, and we can go from there.
  - [Persuade] One thing first... the patients in the medical bay were killed with a lethal dose of sedatives. Know anything about that?
  - Wanted to know if you knew anything - and you don't.
  - I trust you. And if we work together, we may be able to get out of this mess.
  - Alright let's go.
  - ...
  - Sounds like you're about to tell me something I don't want to hear.
  - [Repair] That wouldn't be standard procedure in an emergency lockdown.

- HK50
  - How do you know me? I'm not your Master.
  - Who was your previous Master?
  - What happened?
  - Why don't you tell me anyway?
  - How come I don't remember any of this?
  - Incapacitated?
  - Drugged?! What do you mean drugged?
  - So I wasn't sealed in the cargo hold - someone locked me in.
  - Fine - what happened next?
  - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
  - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
  - Bounty?
  - But why would that ship have taken me off the Harbinger?
  - How so?
  - **Why would someone want me captured?**
  - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
  - That information wouldn't have been in coreward databases... only in Jedi archives.
  - Potential hostiles?
  - I see... go on.
  - Then what happened?
  - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
  - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
    - Are there any left alive?
    - **Then I need to get in there to rescue them. (LSP)**
    - Can we try to contact them using a comlink?
    - Satisfaction?
    - We don't know what happened to them, so we need to find out.
    - **Those miners could be hurt or in danger - we need to make sure they're all right. (LSP)**
    - I'm your Master, and I'm giving you an order to assist me.
    - This just keeps getting better and better. Who's got the damn code?
    - If you have the code, then give it to me.
    - Voiceprinted?
    - But you do know the code.
    - Leave "condescending" out of your speech conditionals from now on, or else.
    - Fine. Now tell me how to get off this rock.
    - I had some other questions for you.


- HIM
  - What are you?
  - Veiled threats?
  - What's a translation droid doing on Peragus?
  - What have you determined?
  - I never said you were coming with me.



- T3?
  - Have you seen a T3 unit?
  - The unit was last seen near the hangar.
  - Then maybe you can answer something else for me.


- Cadaver
  - What's that body there?
  - Screams?
  - Wait - if you can play back his voice, can't you speak the voice code?
  - Believed to possess?
  - [Persuade] The fact you can mimic voices is pretty impressive. What would it sound like if you did speak the code to the console?
  - Can you follow me and say that again?
  - Looks like I'll need to find some way to carry your voice there - or record it.
  - No, I had some other questions I wanted to ask you.




- Kill all droids
- Kill floating mines with gun
- Console -> voice print -> LATER after Atton Suggest -> but loot
- Back to admin level
- Talk to Atton
  - I found a... talkative... protocol droid down in the fuel depot.
  - No, I thought about it, though.
  - And you can?
  - I need to open an airlock, but it's sealed with a voiceprint protocol by the maintenance officer.
  - It looks that way.
  - I have a sonic sensor and the code - I just need to find the right words to record.
  - The miners may still be alive, they're trapped in the dormitory section.
  - None that I know of.
  - **I'm not leaving them trapped and helpless on this facility. (LSP)**
  - I'll return if I find anything.

- Kreia
  - Just checking to make sure you're all right.
  - As "helpful" as your cryptic warnings are, why don't you find some way to make yourself useful?
  - I keep hearing your voice as I explore this place.
  - Unforeseen consequences?
  - What if it doesn't pass?
  - I don't care... just stay out of my head, got it?
  - All right, then - I'll be back.

  - I found a T3 unit in one of the fuel pipes. It looks damaged.
    - I had some more questions for you.
  - REVIEW THIS PART - HK 50
    - How do I know you again?
    - Tell me everything that happened between the Harbinger and now.
    - For a droid, you don't take orders too well. Now tell me what happened.
    - And where was I when this was taking place?
    - There - you said "locked" again.
    - But how did I get from the Harb...
    - Any idea what had attacked the small freighter?
    - What was this freighter that the Harbinger brought on board?
    - And the Ebon Hawk came here?
    - What happened once the ship arrived?
    - How did they find out I was a Jedi?
    - "Unpleasantness?" What are you talking about?
    - Then what happened?
    - So what happened to the rest of the miners?
    - Sadly enough? What do you mean?
      - Are you responsible for all this? (interesting for the plot...)
      - I think you are responsible.
      - Do you know who administered sedatives to the kolto tanks in the medical bay, killing the incapacitated miners?
      - Is that pride I hear in your voice?
      - I had some more questions for you.
  - Enter voiceprint
  - Open inner door
  - loot space suit
  - Open outer door (notice it closed the inner door!)


- Outside
- Atton
  - I'm right outside the observation window.
  - I need to reach the miners in the dormitory section, and this is the only way to get there.
  - I'm trying to pick up the pace, believe me.

    - Enemy?
    - Wait - who is this enemy?
    - "We?" There is no "we" here.
    - Then let's go.
  - HK-50
    - Atton, there's no time to explain - grab a weapon, and follow me.
    - No, you were clear, I just don't listen to assassin droids.
    - Whatever you say, "murder" still means "murder" to me.
    - So you mimicked the maintenance officer's voice to control the droids and kill all the miners in the medical bay?
    - And so you ordered the mining droids to kill me?
    - Why did you want to capture me?
    - You found me. Obviously I didn't do a good job.
    - Who is this client of yours?
    - So what now? Are you going to kill me?
    - I don't want to fight you, but I will if you leave me no other choice.

- Enter Harbinger
  - There's nowhere else to go - the facility is sealed off.
    - Atton's right - we need to get off this ship.
  - We can bypass the force field to the hangar by getting to the engine room on this ship, then exiting through the fuel pipe.
  - Then how did this ship dock here?
  - So let's get their codes, then. Then we can worry about reaching the Ebon Hawk.

- Find back T3
  - I know - we ran into the "protocol droid" earlier, he attacked us, too.
  - How did you survive?
  - He just dumped you into this fuel pipe?
  - Sounds like he just wanted to keep you out of the way until he could find a way off the station... with us.
  - Don't blame yourself. If you hadn't gotten us out of the administration level, we'd have never made it this far.
  - Come on, then - we have to hurry.
- Get back T3 inventory (with mod)
- Level up -> SHOULD BE LEVEL 6 -> BUG?? -> Switch first map load -> level 5 -> reload save -> 6

- Kreia joins you (107_PER)
  - Kreia? Your hand - what happened?
- Ebon Hawk leave
  - Keep as much distance between them and us as you can.
  - Can we jump to hyperspace?
  - Just do your best to keep your distance - we'll get out of this yet.
  - **No - someone might still be alive in the facility.** (LSP)
- Ebon jumps hyperspace
  - Atton & Kreia
    - The Harbinger was on its way to Telos?
    - How did you know I was on board the Harbinger?
    - How come I don't remember any of this?
    - That's an unusual set of coincidences.
    - How did we get to Peragus?
    - He says he repaired the ship and got us to Peragus.
    - So why are these Sith looking for me?
    - But I was exiled from the Jedi Order.
    - But... last of the Jedi? That can't be true.
    - What about the Jedi on Dantooine? And Coruscant?
    - **If any survivors still live, we need to warn them.** (LSP)
    - Then how do we stop the Sith?
    - So what do you think we should do?
    - What do you mean?
    - **This is self-defense, not war.** (LSP)
    - **If evil is not fought, then we sacrifice the galaxy.** (LSP)
    - **You're right, she may need help - can you handle things up here?** (LSP)
    - What makes you say that?
    - She didn't seem in pain to me.
    - That's a poor assumption to be making.
    - When did you get sensitive?
    - I'll go check on her, then.
  - Level 9 
  - Kreia
    - **Your hand - is there anything I can do?** (LSP)
      - // **I'm sorry for your loss.** (LSP) -> NO -> inf-- on Kreia
        - If we travel together, then we need to work together.
        - The pain I felt when you lost your hand - what if it had been more intense?
      - **If I felt the loss of your hand, what would have happened if you had died?**
      - More extreme? I felt like my hand was dipped in molten carbonite.
      - Quicker? Would it have killed me?
      - **What can we do? I don't want my actions to place you at risk.** (LSP)
      - I have never heard of a link like this before, in holocrons, or in the Jedi histories.
      - [You and Kreia possess the Force Chain special ability. When either of you uses a Force power on yourself, the other gains the benefit as well.]
      - I think I've heard enough.
      - **The fool has a name. I'd like you to start using it.** (LSP)
    - Atton (003EBO.mod\003atton.dlg)
      - Cryptic as always.
      - But to know the future, one must know yourself.
      - But to teach, one must be willing to learn.
      - I don't think Kreia is a Jedi.
      - "Good-looking?" Are you that desperate?
      - **Look, ease off the insults. She was wounded helping us escape, remember?** (LSP)
      - Getting empathy from you is like squeezing water from a stone.
      - Forget it. Just keep your mind on piloting this crate.
      - UNREACHABLE: -> change script arg condition from 5 to 6 -> FINE!!
        - What do you mean, "not much use?"
        - Who voice-printed the astrogation system?
        - Why would someone lock the astrogation system?
        - Do you know anything about that assassin droid?
        - Since when do protocol droids collect bounties?
        - Are we still on course for Telos?
      - All right, I'll do that.
      - To what?
      - My lightsaber was... taken from me, by the Council.
        - **It was a single hilt.**
        - **Both the blade and crystal were unique.**
        - **It was a viridian blade, one the Jedi Order had never seen before.**
        - I think having it would just drive them to hunt me harder.
    - T3-M4 -> IF UNREACHABLE DISCUSSION WAS PATCHED (Dialogs.bif\t3m4.dlg)
      - T3, what's wrong with the astrogation system? -> Failed
      - I know it's damaged.
      - Can you try to work on it when you get the chance?
      - I know you can do the calculations, but we may get separated.
      - **No, I'm not planning to leave you behind, but it happens.** (Infl+T3, LSP)
      - Forget it. I had some other questions.
    - Kreia (starts by claiming you should keep an eye on Atton)
      - I had other questions for you.
      - Can you tell me what has happened since the Mandalorian Wars?
        - Tell me about the Mandalorian Wars.
        - **But only some Jedi Knights answered the call... like I did.**
        - And Revan and Malak refused to wait.
        - Until we destroyed them... at Malachor V. (Kreia's empthy for once!!)
        - Many Jedi died at Malachor V... and the conflict split the Jedi Order.
        - But some battles must be fought. It was not Revan's failing. (any answer is interesting, let's take this one)
        - Didn't the Jedi Order try to stop them?
        - How were Malak and the Sith defeated?
        - But what happened to Revan?
        - So Revan saved the Republic?
        - **Then we must do what we can until it has a chance to recover from the war.** (LSP)
        - **Can anything be done to help the Republic?** (LSP)
        - This threat is directed against me?
        - This is a lot to take in at once. I need time to reflect on this.
        - Will do. I'll go see him now. [End Dialog]
  - Reask Kreia
    - I had other questions for you.
    - When we were on Peragus, I could feel the Force again.
      - It was like a whisper, at the edge of hearing. -> other lie of Kreia -> Cut from the force
      - I don't believe the Jedi would do such a thing.
      - It's not possible to cut one off from the Force. It's like deafening someone... or blinding them.
      - I don't believe the Jedi would inflict such a punishment on someone. It seems... too cruel.
      - I thought I had lost it by my actions, by forgetting my training and the teaching of the Jedi.
      - Can my connection to the Force be healed?
      - But the Force... I can feel it again, if only slightly. -> lie -> "Link" -> propose to be her padawan
      - But there are no more Jedi.
      - **I would welcome whatever aid you offer.** (LSP +infl)
  - Reask Kreia
    - I had other questions for you.
    - I need to know more about the Sith hunting us.
      - There was another Jedi Civil War?
      - Are they following Malak's path?
      - The Sith on Peragus knew some Force techniques, but they were extremely weak.
      - There were other questions I wished to ask you.
    - So what do we do now?
      - Is there any place where we can retreat to?
      - **Enough for what?** or alt **Where are we bound again?**
        - And if we find no trace of Jedi teachings on Telos to help us?
- Discover HK-47
  - Repair + install the vocabulator
- See T3
  - Do you know where that HK droid in the cargo bay came from? (!c_influence_bet(8,25,75)) -> FAILED
    - That didn't sound very convincing. Are you sure you don't know?
    - I had other questions for you.
  - You look like you've suffered a lot of damage over the years.
    - How much damage?
    - So you lost a lot of programs in your behavior core - in addition to the damage to your frame?
    - Well, I'm sure you'll gain that skill back. I'm glad to have you along.
    - [Computer] I might be able to upgrade your memory core. 
      - -> INFL ok with astronav fix 
      - (!c_influence_bet(8,40,60) -> function args need check)
      - Ok -> 8 = T3-M4, 40 < infl < 60
    - [Computer] All right. Let me take a look. 
      - (success if Computer >= 9)
    - All done. How do you feel?
    - **[Due to your computer skills, T3 has gained +1 Intelligence.]**
    - What do you mean, I faded out there for a second? You were shut down.
  - QUIT
  - [Repair] You look like you're in need of some routine maintenance. (!c_influence_bet(8,40,60))
    - [Repair] Just sit still. This won't take long.
      - (success if Repair >= 9)
    - That should do it. You doing all right?
    - **[Due to your repair skills, T3 has gained +1 Constitution.]**
    - Glazed look? What are you talking about?
  - QUIT
  - [Computer] Mind if I try to upgrade your memory core again? (!c_influence_bet(8,30,70))
    - [Computer] All right. Let me take a look. (!c_sc_com_lt(15)) -> ok with Exchange belt + helmet + gloves -> 23
    - That should up your processor speed.
    - **[Due to your computer skills, T3 has gained an additional +1 Intelligence.]**
    - Blank look? What, me? I was working on you this whole time.
  - [Repair] Ready for some more routine maintenance? (!c_influence_bet(8,30,70))
    - [Repair] I'll try and make this quick. (!c_sc_com_lt(15))
    - All done with the response package. Give it a spin.
    - [Due to your repair skills, T3's response systems have improved, giving him +1 Dexterity.]
    - No, I'm fine. I guess I just caught up in my work.
  - [Computer] I'd like to upgrade your core again. (!c_influence_bet(8,20,80)) -> NOPE not yet
  - [Repair] (!c_influence_bet(8,30,70)) -> ok -> 21 REPAIR -> too much even with upgrade equipment
- We'll need to wait more
- Unequip T3 blaster
- Head to Telos


- Arrest
  - Are we under arrest?
  - **This is outrageous. You don't have any evidence.**
  - Will I be able to get my gear back?
  - No. Why are you holding us?
  - The TSF can't hold me for anything. We're leaving right now. Do you understand?
  - I'll go... but one way or another, you'll pay me for the trouble.
- You are in prison
  - A force cage? This is ridiculous.
  - Wait - I had some questions.
- Batu Rem 
  - You're wrong. I'm no Jedi.
  - We're in a TSF station. How do you expect to get away with this?
  - I don't wish to fight you.
- Grenn comes
  - Impressive. You allowed an assassin to infiltrate your ranks.
  - How did he manage to sneak in here?
  - Great. That's reassuring.
  - The best of your ability? That's not very inspiring.
  - Just take me to my quarters.


- Tp to your appartment
  - How long will I be here?
  - Why do we need to leave?
  - What do you think, Kreia?
  - (Rest.)
- Call
  - Accept call.
  - What does he want?
  - Fine, send him in.
  - Why didn't he come himself?
  - What does Chodo want with me?
  - No, could you explain it to me?
  - No, what troubles have you had?
  - How is Czerka harming the restoration project?
  - Why would Czerka do this?
  - How did they take the Restoration Zones?
  - Could you get to the point?
  - What do you mean?
  - I'll speak with your leader when I'm freed.
- Call
  - Accept call.
  - What does she want?
  - Why are you calling?
  - "Imposed guilt?"
  - What sort of rumors?
  - I don't recall him threatening me.
  - No, he didn't mention anything like that.
  - Go on.
  - How are the Ithorians in the way of things?
  - What sort of work are we talking about?
  - I'll come by when I can.
  - (Rest.)
- Kreia & Atton talks...
- Green comes back (203tel/203atton.dlg)
  - Why is the Republic sending a ship?
  - How long will I have to stay?
  - Is the Ebon Hawk still impounded?
  - What about my T3 droid?
  - You know that from experience?
  - Why would Telos be doomed?
  - What do you think, Kreia?
  - Why don't we ask the Republic for help against the Sith?
- You're free!


- Talk to Atton
  - What do you mean?
  - I'm fine. In fact, I haven't felt this good in a long time.
  - Nothing, never mind. [End Dialog]
- Leave your appartment
- Loot all appartments in the complex
- Civilian appear (203tel.mod/civilian.dlg)
  - Just looking around.
  - Sorry, I just figured...
  - When you put it that way...
  - I'll be going now. [End Dialog]
