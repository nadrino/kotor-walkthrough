## Upper Taris - Safe Room

- Carth talks to you
    - **I had a strange dream. Like a vision or something.**
    - **I guess I owe you my life. Thanks.**
    - Bastila? She's the one from the Endar Spire, right?
    - How do you even know Bastila's still alive?
    - If Bastila's a Jedi, she can probably look after herself.
    - Battle Meditation? What's that?
    - //So what do you suggest we do next?
    - Any idea where we should start looking for Bastila?
    - I want to ask you some questions.
    - What can you tell me about this planet we're on?
    - What do you know about Malak and the Sith?
    - A Jedi? What do you mean?
    - I would like to ask you something else.
    - I'd like to know some more about you, Carth.
    - The sooner we start looking for Bastila the sooner we find her. Let's go.
- Loot the crate near the workbench 
- Improve your sword with ????
- Leave the room with Carth

> at this moment helping her is clearly not the priority.
