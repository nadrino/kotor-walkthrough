> On XBox you should have the Calrissian's Utility Belt in Carttis inventory if you used the mod. (TODO: put the link!!)
> This item is gonna be necessary latter to trigger more dialog options.
>
> On the original version of the game on XBox (and XBox One), this item can't be aquired anywhere in the game.
> However, the item in itself is present in the game.
> It seems like Bioware added this item but forgot to check if it was buyable before the release on PC.
