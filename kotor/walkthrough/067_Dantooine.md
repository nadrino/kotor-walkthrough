## Go to Dantooine (LAST TIME)

- Go out and take HK and Zaalbar (level up 15)
- Buy
	- Calrissian's Utility Belt ? -> On Xbox not present -> need to have put a mod when first loaded this area!!
    - Equip -> 17 Repair
- HK -> last memory
    - I would like to try restoring some of your memory.
    - Let's get started.
    - ...
    - What? Why not?
    - Are you sure your core isn't just damaged?
    - You are eager to find your origins, are you?
    - Wellâ€¦
    - So tell me about this last owner, then.
    - It appears no one could resist using your protocol.
    - I suppose I would, at that.
    - Oh? Why is that?
    - So you killed *that* master directly.
    - You are just a travelling piece of bad luck, aren't you?
    - You don't want to hear the answer to that.
    - So you couldn't kill Mandalore, hey?
    - So can you remember anything else?
    - [Because of your repairs, HK-47 will now regenerate at a rate of 1 vitality point every 3 seconds and has gained an additional +2 bonus to his dexterity.]
- Go to Matale's Mention -> Speeder
	- [Slice into the speeder and activate its alarm system.] [1 spike]
	- I don't know who set off the alarm. I was just passing by.
- Kill -> Then auto stop
	- You must pay for your crimes, Zuulan.
	- That's a small price to spare your life.
	- I can't just let you go. You are a slaver.
- Transit back
- Back to Ebon
    - Jolee (6/8)
		- Do you want to talk about the war now?
		- **[Persuade] No time like the present? -> easy**
		- Um... no, I don't remember.
		- What does your wife have to do with the war?
		- The war...?
		- And what did she think of all this?
		- So what happened?
		- **So she had fallen to the dark side?**
		- You killed her?
		- But... she was a Sith then, right?
		- They put you on trial?
		- So that's the source of all this bitterness? They found you guilty?
		- I don't understand...
		- And you still believe love is worth the risk?
    - SAVE
    - Go to Tatooine
    - (can't go to Kashyyyk : meet Bandon too soon)
