- To the ship
  - Disciple
    - _{Gameplay Programmer: This cut scene takes place on the Ebon Hawk, the Disciple is studying a series of holographic worlds in the center of the ship.}_
    - _{Gameplay Programmer: The player walks up to the Disciple, studies the worlds with him.}_
    - What are you studying?
    - It is difficult to turn away from the suffering of others - that is why one must help when they can.
    - [Awareness] There's something about the worlds themselves, isn't there? `c_sc_awa_gt(12)`
    - Are you sure you have no idea?
    - I would let it rest - thinking too hard about it will not make the answers come any easier.
  - DONT SPEAK TO KREIA CAUSE YOU REACH LVL 15 -> WAIT FOR NEW LEVEL!
  - Disciple
    - I did not leave the Order - I was exiled.
    - You saw the record. There was no choice - it was a sentence.
    - Why does this interest you?
    - I still don't believe it.
    - Are you sure I don't know you? You look familiar - more so than before. `c_influence_bet(11, 31, 69)`
    - So you turned away from the Jedi - the Force. Because of me?
    - I am sorry that my leaving for war had such... consequences on your future. `a_givelight(1);a_influence_inc(11, 1)`
    - So are you some sort of spy for the Senate?
    - Why did they choose you?
    - Have you had any luck?
    - Do you know what happened to the Jedi?
- Leave with Bao and Kreia
- Go to the cave
- Ahrnell
  - My apologies.
  - I'm just exploring. What are you doing?
  - [Awareness] You are different from most of the mercenaries I've met. `c_sc_awa_gt(11)`
  - You mentioned crystals?
  - [Awareness] The energy you speak of is the Force. I sense some small Force potential within you.
  - I am a Jedi.
  - What do you know about the other mercenaries
  - Why do they keep you out of the loop?
  - Why do you get special privileges?
  - [Persuade] I am an explorer, like you. You can share your secret with me. `c_sc_per_gt(11)`
  - Do you have an extra scent gland I could use?
  - [Persuade] I want to hold your gland.
  - Okay, you can have it back.
- Right to crystals
- Kreia
  - You said the crystals absorb the Force? I feel strange, but not weaker.
  - Tell me more about these crystals.
  - I don't like the idea of leaving behind evidence.
  - Okay.
- Crystal
  - I don't need this. Do you want it?
  - Bah, I've gained a pet crystal. I hope I don't have to feed it.
  - What makes this crystal so special?
  - Is the bond... dangerous?
  - Does the crystal feed off of the Light Side of the Force?
  - Okay.
- Talk to Kria on lvl up -> free level up!
  - It was Visas' Master - he can feel my presence in the Force.
  - Jedi Watchmen should return to the galaxy, and I will be the first to restore them.
    - _From here on, you guide your destiny. But in order to take the next steps, **you must face your past and put it to rest**._
    - `she suggests you to go to Korriban`
- Every body earn a level!!
- Mercenaries
  - So the mercenaries are branching out into kidnapping now?
  - Can I ask you a question?
  - Can we work out some sort of deal?
  - Defend yourselves
- Vrook
  - Always a pleasure, Vrook. I see you still have your cheery disposition.
  - Is this the same "careful timing" you were counting on in the Mandalorian Wars?
  - Revan and Malak were misguided, but without them we'd all be speaking Mandalorian.
- Back
- Sensors
  - What's the problem? We found the sensors. Now we can take them to Saedhe and get paid.
  - [Awareness] Can you examine one of the sensors? `c_sc_awa_gt(4)`
  - Good work Bao-Dur. `a_influence_inc(1)`
- Akul ambush (DS -> possibility for infl+ on Kreia or HK but not yet)
  - What do you want with me?
  - What's in it for me?
  - What do you have in mind?
  - So, you want me to destroy the gun turrets?
  - What about the traps?
  - [Lie] Okay, I'll help you. `Kreia infl+`
  - I'm not interested.
- Saedhe
  - Actually, I've found three of them.
  - Not so fast - we found a little surprise inside them.
  - Why is there surveillance equipment in the sensors?
  - 5000 credits sounds good to me.
- Look the militia put some mines, we are going to move them afterwards
- To the Ebon
- Replace Bao with Atton
- Old man
  - Why so busy?
  - [Awareness] It sounds like you have a lot on your shoulders. `c_sc_awa_gt(11)`
  - [Persuade] You shouldn't keep your frustrations bottled inside. `c_sc_per_gt(9)` `a_influence_inc(6, 1)&&a_local_set(55)` -> Kreia! + Atton
  - You're having trouble with the droids?
  - What's wrong with the doors?
  - Tell me about the turrets.
  - I'll be going now.
- Level up Disciple
- Get in the ebon hawk
