- Interpellation
	- What? Why?
	- …
	- Get me out of here!
	- Arbiter?
	- I don't need anyone to represent me!
	- What have I been charged with?
	- It's all the Sith's fault!
	- How will you get me free?
	- **I had authorization to enter.**
	- I have no prior association.
	- Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?
	- How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?
	- **I think I'd rather represent myself.**
	- No, I'll represent myself.
	- …
	- Not guilty.
	- **I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.**
	- I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!

## Show proof to Shaelas

    - I have information for you, Shaelas.
    - The Sith are training the Selkath youth in the ways of the Dark Jedi.
    - I've convinced your daughter to turn her back on the Sith ways.
    - I hope so.
    - **Keep your credits, Shaelas. A Jedi has no need of such rewards.** +2PCL sinon 500c -> PCL vont être important…
- 2 LSP + 600 PX
- Elora (SAVE)
    - [Persuade] Was Sunry having an affair? 
        -> NEED SUCCEED -> otherwise fail -> Jolee saves -> but NO XP -> in fact ok (patch on XBox ?)

    - Don't worry... I’ll save him (other already)

    - There's a few things we have to clear up.
    - The judges said you left after the shot was fired.
    - There's a few things we have to clear up.
    - There was a Rodian who planted evidence at the murder scene.
    - I know you're guilty, Sunry. I've got the Republic's data recording.
    - But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?
    - **I don't know.**
    - Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!
    - These are just excuses, Sunry. We both know you have to own up to your crimes.

        - **Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?**
        - **Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?**
        - I have no additional questions.
        - (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut
    - (Gluupor)
        - **Did you see Sunry kill Elassa?**
        - **Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue?**
        - **Did you plant the medal on Elassa?**

        - (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut

        - (Yes.) -> Judges poll -> does not make sense -> Cut
    - (Closing)
        - **No one actually witnessed the murder.**

    - Oh, no, not another story!
    - This is a very long story.
    - Am I supposed to be the snake?
    - **Are you saying you're frightened of me?**
