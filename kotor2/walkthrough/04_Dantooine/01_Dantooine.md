- Go out with Bao and T3! -> Kreia will intervine -> not much sense given the answer of Dillan
- Dillan
  - What are you talking about?
  - Hey, my ship is not banged up!
  - **I'm just visiting. I lived here once.**
    - // INTERESTING ALT WITH MIRA (not yet in the group)
    - {snorts}So you used to be a farmer? ...
  - Yes, but much has changed since I was last here. <- your answer
    - //I haven't been back since I left for the Mandalorian Wars. <- more coherent with reply
  - Where is Khoonda?
    - This is your center of government?
    - I'd be more impressed if there weren't so many holes.
  - Why do I need permission to enter the Enclave?
  - Who is Administrator Adare?
  - I'll be going now.
- Level up Bao and T3??
- Bao as a melee knight
- Droid "Greetings and good day, traveler. On behalf of the Khoonda settlement I am programmed to welcome you to Dantooine."  + `BaoDur` baneter
  - That's very observant of you, T3! `a_influence_inc(8, 1)`
  - Droid, what happened to damage you?
  - Sith invasion?
  - **[Computer] Droid, run a self diagnostic and report.** `c_sc_com_gt(1)`
  - [Repair] Fix the droid's memory unit. `c_sc_rep_gt(5)`
  - No, you must be mistaken.
  - [Persuade] The droid is obviously malfunctioning. Do I look like a Jedi? `c_sc_per_gt(7)&&c_lightsaber_eq()`
  - Why do you hate the Jedi?
  - Can you be more specific?
- Reask the droid
  - Why did you call me a Jedi?
    - Tell me about the invasion.
    - What do you know of me specifically?
    - Is that all?

    - Seems like Dantooine has had a lot of trouble.
    - I might cause some trouble of my own, actually.
    - I've got a few questions about the other people here in the settlement.
  - I've heard rumors there's a Jedi around here.
    - Do you know if the rumor is true?
    - If no one says anything on their behalf, the rumor can feed on itself.

    - Why is this place so overrun with kinrath?

- Admin
  - It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm <FirstName>.
    - **Why do you want to know?**
    - I'd prefer if you keep that quiet, Jedi don't seem to be liked here. Or practically anywhere these days.
    - What do you mean by that?
