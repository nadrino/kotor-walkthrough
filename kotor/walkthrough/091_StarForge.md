## Finding Malak

## Defeating Malak

- Malak
    - The light side is stronger than you know, Malak.
    - I will never serve the dark side again, Malak!
    - I believe in the power of redemption.
- The battle starts!!!
- It's the moment to use all your stimulants!
- Start to try and kill him -> hard -> use Shock++ if needed
- Malak
    - Is there some point to this?
- Kill all the healers (with shock++ -> if not enough force power -> kill him)
- Finish him (use all stimulants + speed++)
    - This is the way of the dark side, Malak: all things end in death.
    - I am sorry I started you on this path. But you chose to continue down it.
- You leave
    - Darth Malak is dead. It's over, finally.
