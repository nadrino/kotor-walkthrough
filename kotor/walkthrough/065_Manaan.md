# Court

- Interpellation
	- What? Why?
	- …
	- Get me out of here!
	- Arbiter?
	- I don't need anyone to represent me!
	- What have I been charged with?
	- It's all the Sith's fault!
	- How will you get me free?
	- **I had authorization to enter.**
	- I have no prior association.
	- Um... Don't you need to ask more questions?
	- How can you expect to defend me without getting more information?
	- **I think I'd rather represent myself.**
	- No, I'll represent myself.
	- …
	- Not guilty.
	- **I was investigating the disappearances of young Selkath.**
	- I have this datapad as proof that the Sith are up to no good!

	- But the Sith found out the truth, didn't they?
	- **I don't know.**
	- Killing your lover while she sleeps is murder - even if she is a Sith!

		- **Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she?**
		- **Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious?**

	- (Closing)
