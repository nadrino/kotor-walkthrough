        - Commander Hasek:
            - In regards to the system in place to cycle water from the ocean to the thermal heaters:
            - What were you thinking?!? What made you put that airlock mechanism on the only other path to the north side of the base?? Now everyone has to know how to cycle the water out of one room and into the adjoining one for each of the three rooms in sequence without accidentally flooding the room they're in. We lost seven troopers just this week!
            - Next time I'm there you better show me how to do it properly! I can't afford to lose any more of my aides while trying to get to the Selkath!
        - Adjutant:
            - Sorry, sir, but we had to change the pump mechanism since one of those fish people swam into one of the intakes outside.
            - The **external flow controls** push the water into the chambers **north and south** only now. The flow controls on the **inside wall switches** the water between **sides east and west**.
            - The trick now is to push the water to the north and south extremes, then switch the water east-west and walk through. The meters by the flow control panels show if there is water in the adjacent room. We've also installed lifeform detection sensors, so there shouldn't be any more aide problems...
            - We're trying to get the system passed as quickly as possible, sir, but the Selkath authorities monitoring our base have made this much more difficult.
