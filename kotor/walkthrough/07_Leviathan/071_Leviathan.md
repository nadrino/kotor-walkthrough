## T3-M4 to the Rescue

- T3-M4 is being hacked
    - [You sense the other droid attempting to access your higher memory areas. You will need to take key opportunities to interfere with the process and slice the enemy droid in turn.]
    - [A stream of numbers is being loaded into your core memory systems. By completing the series you can corrupt the data stream and disrupt the other droid's programming.]
    - 3 (Fibonacci numbers in reverse order)
    - [A new series of numbers are inbound. By completing the series you can corrupt the data stream and disrupt the other droid's programming.]
    - 10 (only remaining two-digit binary combination)
    - [Disrupting one more data stream by completing the series should wipe out all communication processing systems and force the enemy droid into permanent shutdown.]
    - 11 (next prime number)
- Loot the chest in the back of the room: 6 repair parts
- Repair the droid (5 parts)
- +1040 PX
- Stay in retreat, let the droid be at the front
- Take down the ramp on the right. (Follow the droid)
- Kill SIth on the left -> loot -> access pass to open the cells
- The droid open the next room (with the computer) -> 2 sith

- Loot the locked chest on the other side of the corridor (4 Spikes!)
- Loot the cylinder in the computer room ? **-> later**
- Brig Terminal (don't use the ICE breaker now)
    - [Computer] Slice the computer. (0)
    - [Computer] Access system commands.
    - [Computer] Open detention area. (1)
    - +320 PX (or kind of)
- Go to the detention area -> save the crew

 40 * 3 + 50 * 5
 120 + 250 = 370 (480 sinon)
 
 120+160+
 
 135670
 
 136350 (370 + 480)
 136054
 136406
 
 136606 (40*3 + 480 + 320)


## Freeing the Crew

- Free the crew
    - **Let's get our equipment and blast our way to those bridge controls!**
    - **Careful, Carth, there's more at stake here than personal revenge.**

    - Forget it, Carth. Whatever he said he was only trying to hurt you.
    - What are you two talking about? What's going on?

    - Why did the Jedi spare me? I don't understand...
    - ...
    - I'm... Darth Revan? How is that possible?
    - **No, I don't believe you, Malak!**
    - Why wouldn't the Jedi simply kill me?
    - **How did they capture someone as powerful as Revan... I mean, me?**
    - But why did you betray... your master?
    - Bastila, is this true?
    - Then why don't I remember being Revan?
    - You've been lying to me this whole time, Bastila!
    - Why not just let me die?
    - But why program me with another identity?
    - Why you, Bastila? Why did the Council choose you?
    - But what if I remembered who I really was?
    - I understand, Bastila. You had no other choice.
    - Triumph, Malak? You seem to forget that I'm still alive!
- Bastila and Carth are put under statis -> you confront him alone
- At mid-HP -> stops -> contourner les portes
- Again -> kill -> Bastila
- Bastila does like..
- Carth is upset!
    - What about Bastila? We have to help her!	
- Go to the Ebon Hawk
- Sith ships try to hunt down the Ebon Hawk!
- Discussion with others
    - We can't help Bastila - not unless we find the Star Forge first.
    - I'll tell them. I'm... I'm Darth Revan.
    - Small bits. A few strange dreams and visions. That's all. -> otherwise Carth says youre lying
    - This changes nothing! I still want to stop Malak!
        - What about you, Jolee?
        - What do you think, Canderous?
        - You won't abandon me, will you T3?
        - What do you have to say, HK-47?
            - Why? What's happening?
            - **Your homing system? What's that?**
            - You mean... Revan?
            - Good. So long as you're loyal.
        - Well, Carth - will you stand with me against Malak?
            - I won't let you down, Carth. I promise.
            - You have to try... for Bastila's sake.
- Now you heads on Kashyyk!
